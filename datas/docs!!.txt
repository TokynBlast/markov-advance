INTRODUCTION
‘‘Capping malpractice payments . . . would do nothing to prevent unsafe practices or
ensure the provision of fair compensation to patients . . .
Apology offered by a health care provider during negotiations shall be kept confidential
and could not be used in any subsequent legal proceedings’’
--- Hillary Clinton & Barack Obama1
Why do large commercial interests-----insurance companies,
manufacturers, hospitals-----pledge millions of dollars to lobby for laws that
encourage apologies? What may explain this very recent interest of
commercial firms in the virtue of apologies? Why did tort reformers come
to adopt the rhetoric of regret, consilience, and penance? And how did the
largest tort reform of the last decades passed with the blessing of its
staunchest opponents?
Tort reform is a highly contentious social agenda. It is based on a
belief that litigation is inherently biased in favor of plaintiffs and must
therefore be reined-in by measures such as damage caps and screening
panels.2 Opponents of tort reform dispute this basic premise; they worry
that limitations on liability would unduly deprive accident victims of much-
needed compensation and would encourage negligent and reckless behavior.
The political pendulum slowly swings between these two positions.
In recent years, tort reformers have found a new and powerful
platform to advance their position, one that allowed them to strike a major
victory in their war against what they perceive as excessive liability.
Apology laws; laws designed to privilege apologies made by injurers,
making them inadmissible at trial. By co-opting the rhetoric and discourse
on apologies and the law-----independently developed by ethicists, dispute
resolution specialists, and legal theorists-----they found a way into the hearts
of legislators and the public. This maneuver has been so effective that even
long-standing opponents of tort reform, such as President Barack Obama,
express support for these reforms.3 In only two decades, 36 states have
adopted apology laws and there is currently a strong push to expand apology

law reform to the federal level and other area of law.4
This Article argues and demonstrates that despite appearances,
apology laws are de-facto tort reform. Looking beyond the virtuous
rhetoric, the effect of apology laws on commercial actors is similar to that
of damages caps.5 At the heart of our argument is the overlooked claim that
apology laws undercut the deterrent effect of tort liability.6 We base our
argument on tort theory as well as research in psychology, economics,
sociology, and marketing. We contend that apology laws encourage
strategic apologies by commercial actors who do not express a real
commitment to avoid future wrongdoing. Commercial apologies exploit the
human tendency to forgive, which has myriad psychological, social, and
evolutionary reasons. For any of these reasons, victims forgive and settle
for a fraction of the value of their claims, foregoing hundreds of thousands
of dollars in compensation. Because commercial actors can anticipate in
advance that they will pay victims low amounts, they have less of an
incentive to invest in precautions that would prevent accidents in the first
place. In other words, apologies dilute deterrence, making it better to be
sorry than safe. We further argue that new market solutions and new trends
‘‘professionalize’’ and facilitate the tender of apologies by commercial
actors, thus greatly amplifying their harmful effects.7

cheap talk’’ as ‘‘the only thing that is relevant is the expected magnitude of penalties.’’

Achieve Credibility, 32 INT. REV. L. ECON. 178, 178 (2012). For this reason, Mungan
proposes that a special penalty will be levied on those who apologize. Id., at 179. Our
approach here is broader and we acknowledge the cost of delivering an apology, although
we believe that it is much smaller for commercial actors.

7 We also explain that even if apologies are not merely strategic, i.e., they have a
real cost for the injurer, they may be socially undesirable. The reason, which we explain in

The policy implications of our argument flow from understanding
the democratic gap inherent in these laws, as well as their potential harmful
implications for victims’ safety and welfare. Because our points here were
overlooked and avoided public scrutiny or scholarly analysis, we believe
that as a first measure, all planned future expansions of these laws-----to more
states, the federal level, and other areas of law-----should be suspended. The
effect of these laws on safety must be carefully evaluated, especially in the
context of medical malpractice where apologies are becoming
institutionalized and streamlined. Public discourse should internalize the
homomorphism of apology laws and tort reform and judge them
accordingly. Finally, judges should be made aware of the side effects of
apologies and learn to approach them with greater caution in commercial
settings.
Our argument explains, among other things, why we suddenly
witness deep interest from commercial actors in the virtues of apologies in
the context of private law.8 These reformers realized that by using the
uncontroversial rhetoric of apologies and penance they can mobilize
legislators from both parties. Hence, the support of apology laws by
commercial interest should not be viewed as a commendable fusion of social
and moral norms with business practices, but rather a self-interested
decision with potentially harmful social effects.
To provide a sense of the magnitude of the effect commercial
apologies have on victims, it is useful to consider the results of studies done
on payments to victims in states that enacted apology laws.9 These studies,
concentrating on hospitals, show a reduction of as much as 60% in payments
to victims. This translates to a reduction of $32,000-$65,000 in legal
payouts per case,10 which for many victims marks the difference between
greater detail in Section II.A.2, is that damages payments are transfers between individuals
which are, largely, socially neutral. Apologies, per this assumption, have real costs. While it
would be undesirable to replace a costless transfer with a costly action, injurers may
nonetheless do so, especially if they are encouraged by law.
8 We do not address in this paper the topic of public apologies or those made by
states, which raises distinct issues, see MARTHA MINOW, BETWEEN VENGEANCE AND
FORGIVENESS (1998); and Michael R. Marrus, Official Apologies and the Quest for
Historical Justice (Munk Centre, Occasional Paper III 2006).

being able to afford proper treatment for their accidents or suffering from
disability and poverty. For firms, on the other hand, the costs of apologies
are relatively marginal, and there is a large consensus that apologies are
cost-saving devices that can cut down costs by millions of dollars in
regulatory fines, judgments, and public outrage.11
The Article has three Parts. In Part I we explore the unexpected
camaraderie of ethicists and tort reformers. We show how the legal apology
movement was co-opted by the tort reform lobby to successfully effect tort
reform across the nation. Part II grounds apologies in tort theory and
explains how apologies can undermine deterrence in commercial settings.
Our theoretical analysis suggests that the problem is most acute if apologies
are cheap to produce and have a strong effect on victims. We then survey
recent developments in commercial apologies that show that commercial
apologies have indeed become cheaper and are highly effective. Part III
examines the theoretical and policy implications of these developments. We
argue that the evidence in support of apology law reform is weak and while
much empirical evidence is needed, the existing evidence is consistent with
the concern that apology laws undermine liability. After a brief conclusion,
an Appendix details our analysis using a formal economic model.

I. STRANGE BEDFELLOWS: OF ETHICISTS AND TORT REFORMERS
In recent decades, legal scholars from distinct disciplines-----ethicists,
dispute resolution experts, and sociologists-----have formed a movement that
challenged the traditional approach of the law to apologies. This Part tracks
the rise of this movement and its internal discourse. It then shows how the
rhetoric developed by this movement was co-opted by commercial interests
who lobbied for apology laws in state legislatures. These attempts were
immensely successful, and this part concludes by documenting the change
in the legal landscape.
A. Apologies in Legal Scholarship
In the early 90s, a movement of loosely formed ‘‘Legal Apologists’’
started to gain traction.12 The Legal Apologists critiqued the resolution of
conflict by the legal system for being overly abrasive to the relationship of
the parties. Instead, they argued that apologies can provide an effective and
wholesome solution to disputes. Despite the perception that apologies are
private and informal acts, they argued that the law has an important
facilitative role.13 In their view, the law should encourage individuals to
apologize or, at the very least, not stand in the way of those who wish to
apologize.
The Legal Apologists claimed that apologies have a wide-array of
benefits. When an individual is wronged, an apology by the responsible
party may acknowledge the harm done to the victim and the victim’s

repair relationships); Aviva Orenstein, Apology Excepted: Incorporating A Feminist

Malpractice and Beyond, 57 DEPAUL L. REV. 251, 251 (2008) (“Beginning in the early
1990s, there was a surge of academic and public interest in apologies.”).

16 Psychologists find that apologies have a paradoxical effect. On the one hand,

overarching theme: apologies facilitate dispute resolution in an effective
manner.22 By defusing victims’ desire for vindication,23 apologies avoid
disputes and encourage settlements, thus saving protracted legal proceedings
with their emotional and pecuniary costs.24
To demonstrate that these benefits are not merely theoretical, the
Legal Apologists have set to prove them empirically, mostly in lab settings.
The resulting studies have shown that victims of wrongful conduct report a
strong desire to receive an apology, express satisfaction once this need is
met, and, as a result, manifest a high willingness to settle and forego
litigation.25 A leading example is Jennifer Robbennolt’s work. In a series of

experimental studies, Robbennolt found that apologies increase victims’
belief that they would win their lawsuits, but, paradoxically, that they had
more favorable view of the injurer, were more willing to settle, and were
more receptive to lower settlement offers.26 Robbennolt also found that
victims who received an apology believed that the injurer is more likely to
be careful in the future.27
Armed with theory and evidence, the Legal Apologists quickly swept
legal academia. As others recently noted: “In the last two decades, apology
legal scholarship has become increasingly robust.”28 We found in our
analysis of the literature hundreds of articles on the issue, starting mostly in
the 90s and peaking in popularity in the 2000s.29

apologies would lead victims to accept settlements that do not compensate
them fully.40 Despite these challenges, the movement itself is still going
strong, seemingly in the belief that none of these challenges is
insurmountable-----which, as we will argue, is most understandable if the
literature is read as focusing on interpersonal apologies.

Moving from the high-minded Legal Apologists and their concern
with nuances of ethics, we consider the seemingly unrelated world of tort
reform. Tort reformers, known mostly for their activism in medical
malpractice and product liability, fight to limit the costs imposed on
defendants as a result of litigation, which they believe is excessive and
biased. They argue that the specter of excessive liability affects the industry

. . . could just usher in an epidemic of playacting.”). In one case, for example, a defendant
who was ordered by the court to apologize published an ad in the newspaper—later on the

‘‘defensive medicine’’, i.e., prescribing tests and procedures for the sole
purpose of reducing liability risk.41 Both the costs of liability and those of
defensive medicine are then passed on to the public in the form of higher
health costs (or, in other fields, in the form of higher costs of products and
services). To contain these costs, tort reformers suggest a series of methods
that would curb the threat of excessive liability, such as damages caps.
Opponents challenge these ideas, arguing that there is no evidence that
liability is excessive, that defensive medicine is prevalent, or that tort
reforms have any positive effects on the costs or quality of healthcare.42
To be clear-----and clarity is often lacking in this debate-----tort reform
is not about making the tort system more efficient.43 Both reformers and
their opponents are open to making the system work better at a lower cost.44
The focal point of contention is tort reform’s objective to reduce the
deterrent effect of tort liability. Tort reformers believe that damages in
litigation are too high and so overly-deter potential injurers, such as
physicians, which is the cause of ‘defensive medicine’ practices. Therefore,
their call is to cap money damages as means of curbing the over-deterrent
effect of litigation.45

In terms of political economy, the tort-reform debate pits consumers
and trial attorneys against professional, commercial, and business
interests.46 These opposing camps have mapped into political parties, with
Republicans being strong proponents of tort reform against the opposition
of Democrats, a somewhat ironic division in light of the history of tort law.47
Most notably, President George W. Bush has strongly favored tort reform
at the Federal level, calling to cap all money damages at $250,000,48 while
President Barack Obama has been largely opposed to damage caps.49
Tort reform has marked significant success. According to data
collected by Ronen Avraham in 2012, 21 states have a cap on non-economic

damages, 18 on punitive damages, and 22 on total compensation.50 Matter
and Stutzer recently found that Republican leadership in a state leads to a
large jump in the probability that tort reform will be undertaken.51
According to our own analysis, states that voted Republican in the 2012
election were far more likely to have some damages caps than those that
voted Democratic. Specifically, out of 24 Republican states, 19 had caps,
whereas out of 26 Democratic States, only 16 had caps.
Tort reform has made considerable inroads, but it also faces strong
opposition. First, politically, as we noted Democratic States are traditionally
averse to tort reform. Second, consumer and attorney lobby mounts a strong
opposition. And third, various courts have held damages caps
unconstitutional, mostly due to concerns of their limiting effect on the right
to a trial by jury.52 These challenges limit the ability of tort reformers to
push forward. The difficulty of advancing their agenda through ‘‘the front
door’’ has put pressure on reformers to find alternative venues for progress,
ones that could sidestep the political, interest-group, and legal obstacles.
Realizing this, reformers formed a new alliance with unlikely partners --- the
Legal Apologists.
C. How Tort Reformers Fought and Won the Apology Battle in State
Legislatures

have had a tremendous impact on policy. These ethicists and dispute
resolution specialists found surprising support from the pragmatic and well-
funded tort reform advocates.53 With the rhetoric of the legal apologists and

the lobby efforts of tort reformers, the movement struck a chord with
legislators and judges across the country, prompting them to reform the law
to accommodate the use of apologies.
The same supporters of tort reform back apology laws: insurance
companies, medical associations, and large companies in diverse
industries.54 However, they do so using a new rhetoric, clearly
differentiating between apology laws and tort reforms.55 In Madison,
Wisconsin, for example, ‘‘[t]he medical lobby, supported by powerful
business groups, outmaneuvered trial lawyers . . . and won passage of the
‘I'm sorry" bill’.’’56 This lobby adopted a new rhetoric, arguing that apology
laws are useful not because they curb liability but because ‘‘at these difficult
times, people want, need and deserve compassion.’’57 Similarly, in
Massachusetts, various healthcare organizations lobbied for apology laws
explaining this as a move towards ‘‘a very proactive system where
physicians can advocate for patients who are injured rather than being told
they can't even talk to them.’’58
Tort reformers borrowed from Legal Apologists both the means and
the rhetoric to advance their goals. The most important item on the agenda
of reformers was the creation of ‘‘safe harbor’’ for apologies.59 Apologies

often convey evidence of fault and are therefore admissible at trial.60
Reformers adopted the discourse and rhetoric of the Legal Apologists, who
argued that it would be wrong to punish people who ‘‘did the right thing’’
and apologized.61 The Legal Apologists further argued that existing
evidentiary rules make defendants fear apologies are ‘‘legal suicide’’62 and
provide an undue and unfair barrier to injurers from apologizing.63
The second item on the reformers’ agenda was the promotion of
apologies in less formal settings. Both reformers and legal apologists sought
to promote-----for very different reasons, of course-----the role of apologies in
mediation,64 settlement procedures,65 and the early stages of trial.66 Finally,
the third item was more institutional-----providing judges with the power to
mandate apologies as an additional or substitute aspect of sanctions.67
60 FED. R. EVID. 801(d)(2). Federal law only protects apologies if they are made
during settlement negotiations. See FED R. EVID. 408; Cohen, supra note 12, at 1032-36
(1999). An apology might also be inadmissible if it is implied from an offer to cover medical
expenses, FED R. EVID. 409. The rationale for this rule is that “such payment or offer [to pay
the victim's medical expenses] is usually made from humane impulses and not from an
admission of liability, and that to hold otherwise would tend to discourage assistance to the
injured person.” FED. R. EVID. 409 advisory committee's note.

a moral step"); Orenstein, supra note 12, at 235-36 (“[A] justification for [these rules] arises

We certainly do not want to disadvantage individuals who do the right thing.”).
62 Eisenberg, supra note 39.
63 See Robbennolt, supra note 26, at 465 (“The conventional wisdom among legal
actors has been that an apology will be viewed as an admission of responsibility and will
lead to increased legal liability”, although she also notes that there is no empirical research
to supports this perception). Cohen, supra note 12, at 1010 (1999) (“If a lawyer contemplates

liability”).

See also Zisk, supra note 20, at 390 at 375 and n. 43; Ebert, supra note 20, at 366. The most
prevalent form of apology laws is safe-harbor to expressions of sympathy and empathy (e.g.,
“I am sorry you were hurt”), see, e.g., MONT. CODE. ANN. §26-1-814 (providing safe harbor
for a statement “expressing apology, sympathy, commiseration, condolence, compassion, or
a general sense of benevolence relating to the pain, suffering, or death of a person.”),
although several states provide a more robust protection and make inadmissible even
liability-assuming apologies (e.g., “I am sorry I hurt you through my negligence“).
69 Judges show reluctance to allow an apologetic admission of guilt to be the sole
basis for establishing the breach of a duty of care. In the medical context, see Ebert, supra
note 20, at 349 (“the use of apologies and other extrajudicial statements made by the
physician following a medical error are not alone sufficient to prove negligence.”). See also
Lashley v. Koeber, 156 P.2d 441, 445 (Cal. 1945) (physician’s admission that the mistake is

This fast adoption amazed many: ‘‘Shortly after the idea of excluding
apologies from admissibility into evidence was raised in academic circles .
. . it rapidly spread to the policy arena’’.74 Yet, this success has not satiated
reformers’ appetite; they now seek to expand the scope of apology laws,75
apply them to other areas of civil and criminal law,76 enact them at the
federal level,77 and make them more uniform.78 Additionally, some
advocate that judges be able to compel the government to apologize in civil
rights cases.79
Tort reformers managed an impressive feat. On the one hand, they
draw on the resources and financial support of business interests that invest
hundreds of millions of dollars each year to advance tort reform.80 On the
other hand, they garnered large, bipartisan support. They even swayed

remarkable is that despite his known opposition to tort reform, Barack
Obama co-signed a bill he authored with Hillary Clinton that sought to
establish federal apology safe harbors.82 Democratic lawmakers seem as
keen to adopt apology laws as Republican lawmakers, as evident by wide
adoption in both blue and red states.83
In sum, apology laws are promoted using the rhetoric of virtue,
improved communications, and ethics developed by legal intellectuals.
What is never explicitly noted, let alone considered, is the broader effects
of apology laws on incentives, harms, and other social costs. These issues
are simply suppressed and instead apology laws are framed as a neutral
measure that improves dispute resolution without sacrificing victims’ rights.
The acceptance of these laws by those who traditionally oppose tort reform
thus presents somewhat of a paradox. It is our task now to show why
apology laws undercut deterrence and are thus, in effect, comparable to
other measures of tort reform.
II. COMMERCIAL APOLOGIES: THEORY AND PRACTICE
We have seen that tort-reformers have joined hands with legal
scholars and have managed to change the law in most states. This Part first
provides a theoretical framework that allows evaluating the effect of
apologies on behavior. This theory highlights the importance of the cost of
apologies and their effectiveness; given that, this Part considers separately
both issues, showing how the costs of commercial apologies are declining
while their effectiveness remains considerable.

deterrence of wrongdoers; an important secondary goal is the reduction of
litigation costs.84
Controlling the costs of disputes, and litigation in particular, has
been the prominent theme in the writing of the Legal Apologists.85 They
argued that apologies help reduce litigation through the dissipation of
victim’s anger or need for vengeance. For the most part, the evidence seems
to support this assertion, although recent empirical work casts some doubt.86
From a cost-perspective, then, apologies seem to have a positive effect. If
one approaches a case after a dispute had already arisen, it may be appealing
to focus on controlling its costs. And indeed, most of the Legal Apologists
are conflict resolution experts who meet disputes after they arise.87 But tort
law adopts a broader perspective, and in this view, controlling litigation
costs is generally a secondary consideration.
What has been missing from the Legal Apologists’ analysis is the
effect of apologies on deterrence. In a fundamental oversight, the Legal
Apologists have failed to account for this central goal of tort law. Thus,
they have never accounted for the ex-ante effects of apologies on primary
behavior, namely, how does the possibility of apologizing after the fact
affect injurers’ decisions to engage in harmful activities in the first place?
How do apologies change the level of behavior? Would a more favorable
treatment of apologies by the legal system induce or suppress accidents?
Once considered, reflection reveals a tension between apologies and
deterrence. To the extent that apologies reduce the cost of an accident for
the injurer-----which is the point just discussed-----they provide the injurer with
less of a reason to avoid the accident. Put differently, if apologies allow the

being equal-----much lesser incentive to avoid the activity or to invest in
precautions. This does not mean that the injurer will not care at all or that
the effect of apologies is necessarily negative, but it does imply that injurers
will have less incentive to take care than they would otherwise.88
The other primary goal, compensation, fails to provide clear
guidance. The goal of compensating a victim is to restore her to her status
prior to the accident, by providing her with value that is as close as possible
to her loss.89 On first blush, apologies seem to undercut this goal, because-----
as demonstrated by the apologists themselves-----victims are willing to accept
lower payments in settlements when an apology is tendered.90 However, the
Legal Apologists emphasized that victims care for much more than financial
compensation and the positive emotional and expressive effect of an apology
may well be more important than the payment of money. The contention
here is that apologies are healing and valuable to the victim more than a
monetary payment. Let us call this view the therapeutic value theory of
apologies.
There are strong reasons to be skeptical of the therapeutic value
theory, particularly in the context of commercial apologies. While the
adherents of the therapeutic value theory argue that victims’ acceptance of
apologies is evidence of their value, there are several alternative, less
benign, reasons why victims might accept them and forgo sometimes
hundreds of thousands in compensation.91 We cover five reasons here.
The first two reasons why a victim may be accepting an apology
unwillingly has to do with pressure and manipulation. Gabriel Teninbaum
recently argued, for example, that apologies are used by sophisticated
commercial firms as means of beguiling victims.92 Teninbaum highlighted
certain practices of apologies used by firms that are meant to create
emotional pressure on victims to accept them, a decision that the victims
88 Of course, it may well be that there is too much deterrence in the baseline, so
the change will be favorable. However, there are many reasons to believe that the tort
system is generally under-deterrent, especially given injurers ability to shield assets after
an accident. See generally Yonathan A. Arbel, Shielding of Assets and Lending Contracts,

will later come to regret.93 The strategic, deliberate use of apologies by
commercial firms is designed to maximize this effect and victims are
employing only limited agency in their decision to accept the apology. A
second reason concerns pressure that comes from sources besides the injurer
itself. Pursuant to an apology, victims may still wish to sue; however, they
are often subject to social or internal pressure to avoid doing so, lest they
be perceived as vengeful, unrelenting, or ungrateful. Research in
psychology shows that failure to accept an apology is associated with a
negative perception of the victim.94 Similarly, victims may experience an
internal or social pressure (perceived or real) not to sue, due to the social
norm of accepting apologies.95
The two other reasons are more epistemological. There is a real
question as to whether people understand the meaning of commercial
apologies and how they are different from interpersonal ones. When a firm
apologizes through one of its proxies, is that an expression of guilt? Of
whom? Given how dispersed the decisions and actions in a commercial firm
are, even an apology by the CEO reflects a sliver of the actual responsibility
(aside from the very general sense in which the CEO is the personification
of the firm, a loaded idea by itself).96 What does the apology say about the
future? Would a commercial firm be less likely to recidivate after an

to apologize, 49 J. Exp. Soci. Psy. 315, 315 (2013) (‘‘Victims of transgressions are, in
turn, socialized into graciously accepting such apologies’’). This is in line with the view of
some economists that apologies create a “psychic cost” to suing. See Benjamin Ho & Elaine
Liu, Does Sorry Work? The Impact of Apology Laws on Medical Malpractice, 43 J. RISK

certain conditions it would be blameworthy not to forgive’’); and Espen Gamlund, The
Duty to Forgive Repentant Wrongdoers, 18 INT. J. PHILOS. STUD. 651 (2010) (arguing that
a limited duty to forgive exists), and so it is possible that some people have a mistaken
sense of duty to accept apologies, even when they are not genuine.

apology? The meaning of this apology is an open question, and this leads
us to the fourth reason which has to do with firm anthropomorphism. It is
well known that people do not maintain a clear distinction between
individuals and firms, tending to endow brands and firms with personality.97
Humans have a strong tendency-----potentially related to evolutionary
reasons-----to accept apologies from other humans.98 The concern is that this
instinctive reaction is carried over to brands and firms without proper
reflection. People may intuitively interpret an apology by a firm in a similar
way to how they interpret an apology by a person, much like how
individuals feel that certain brands and companies are ‘warm’ or ‘evil’-----a
phenomenon known as brand personification.99
The final flaw, and perhaps the most fundamental one, is the
unrealistic magnitude of the hypothesized therapeutic effect. Even if
apologies have some healing effect, there must be some limit to the size of
this effect. If victims are willing to forgo small or perhaps even moderate
value claims in exchange for an apology, then it may be that they engage in
a conscious trade-off of pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits, preferring
the latter to the former. However, the greater the amount the victim forgoes,
the less persuasive is the idea that there is a real trade-off of benefits. It is
less persuasive, we think, to argue that a disabled victim of an accident
prefers an apology to amounts large enough to considerably alleviate her
suffering. As we shall show, the effect of commercial apologies can be
measured sometimes in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, a fact that puts
considerable pressure on the therapeutic value theory.100
Overall, we think that there is good reason to suspect the therapeutic
theory of apologies, at least in commercial settings. We cannot completely
overrule the possibility that victims are sophisticated and fully understand
the difference between commercial and personal apologies and find them

nonetheless satisfying-----so satisfying that they are willing to forgo very large
amounts of money in exchange for an apology. Yet, we find this possibility
less probable than the other explanations proposed here. The following
thought experiment might elucidate our skepticism. Consider the common
victim of medical malpractice, who suffered a great harm from negligent
treatment. Suppose that after the accident, she receives an apology from the
hospital staff or the physician, and as a consequence, she is dropping the
lawsuit. Going back in time but knowing what the patient knows now, would
the patient undergo the same procedure again? If the answer is negative,
then it is unlikely that the apology really mended the harm, that it genuinely
compensated the victim for her loss.
Overall, we see tension between the goals of tort law. Cost-reduction
is seemingly favorable to apologies whereas deterrence argues against
apologies. Compensation fails to point in any clear direction, so it does not
provide guidance on how to resolve the tension. To account for this
complexity, we need a theory that accounts for the combined effects of cost-
reduction and deterrence.
2. A Unified Theory of Apologies in Tort Law
To evaluate the combined effect of apologies on behavior, we extend
the traditional model of accidents in tort law to account for apologies. An
informal presentation follows here and the interested reader would find the
formal explication in the Appendix.
In the basic model of tort liability, a potential injurer chooses
whether to engage in a risky activity. The activity has some benefit to the
injurer but may cause harm to the victim. The prototypical example of this
model is driving and the risk of an accident to a pedestrian. An important
aspect of the model is that litigation over the accident is costly. To win the
case, each party has to expend resources on retaining lawyers, hiring expert
witnesses, producing evidence, etc. In addition to these litigation costs,
there are also liability costs, which reflect the payments the injurer would
have to pay the victim if found liable (or if the parties settle). The social
goal is to find rules that minimize costs.101 On this point, it is worth
emphasizing that the economic analysis does not consider the payment of
liability costs to have any direct effect on social welfare --- when a person
pays an amount to another person, then the second person becomes richer
(a social benefit), but this benefit is completely offset by the loss of the first
person.
101 See supra note 84.

26 Draft, [8-Sep-16
To account for apologies, we add to the model the possibility that if
an accident occurs, the injurer may choose to apologize. In order to do that,
it is important to clearly identify the benefits and costs of apologies. On the
side of benefits, the literature points out to two potentially distinct effects:102
the victim is willing to settle more often and is demanding a lower amount
in settlement negotiations.103 The costs are those of tendering an apology,
which may involve loss of face, social stature, or reputation.104 Tendering
an apology is a private cost that is borne by the injurer.
Are apologies after an accident socially desirable? Based on the
extended model, we will now argue that the injurer will tend to apologize
either more or less often than is socially optimal, a point that was not fully
recognized in the literature.105 To see that, consider first the private
incentive to apologize, the way the injurer sees it. From this perspective,
the tender of the apology will involve a cost that the injurer bears, but the
apology will also have a double benefit----- the savings on the injurer’s
litigation and liability costs. If the benefits exceed the cost of apologizing,
the injurer would have an incentive to apologize.
From a social perspective, the calculus is different. From this point
of view, we would again count the cost of tendering the apology. However,
the benefits will be very different. First, the savings on liability costs will
not be counted. As noted, from the social perspective, the fact that the
injurer will save money by not paying the victim the full amount is not a
social benefit, as the injurer’s gain is the victim’s loss. At the same time,
the benefit of reducing litigation costs involves a saving to both the victim
and the injurer, but the injurer will only count her savings, whereas society
will care about the joint savings. We see there is reason for the private
incentive to apologize to diverge from the social optimum, leading the
102 See infra section II.C.
103 Alternatively, apologies reduce payments because juries and judges are more
lenient towards repentant injurers.
104 For example, one public official preferred being sent to prison than a halfway
house because he did not want to apologize, White, supra note 17, at 1269. See also Ebert,
supra note 20, at 334-35 (discussing ego and the difficulty physicians face in admitting their
professional shortcomings).
105 For a similar argument in the broader context of litigation, see Steven Shavell,
The Fundamental Divergence Between the Private and the Social Motive to Use the Legal
System, 26 J. LEGAL STUD. 575 (1997) (explaining that there would generally be too little or
too much litigation because parties’ private incentives to bring suit will often be too weak or
too strong relative to the social optimum).

injurer to apologize too much or too little.106
Example 1. Suppose that an accidental poisonous leak from a nearby
factory caused the victim a harm of $5,000. Further suppose that tendering
an apology would cost $500, but that through this apology, the parties settle
the case-----thus each avoiding $200 in litigation costs. Finally, suppose that
because of the apology, the victim is willing to accept a payment of $2,500,
rather than the $5,000 the victim would have received in litigation. In this
example, an apology will not be socially desirable, as it costs $500, but only
saves $400 in litigation costs. (Recall that the $2,500 saving to the offender
is equal to the victim’s loss). On the other hand, by apologizing the injurer
could save $2,700 (2500+ 200) at a cost of only $400, thus giving her an
incentive to apologize. Since the private incentive to apologize exceeds what
is socially desirable, there will be too much of an incentive to apologize.
Example 1a. Suppose now that the apology costs only $300 to tender
but that it does not reduce the amount in settlement. In this case, the apology
will be socially valuable, as by investing $300, a total of $400 in litigation
expenses could be saved. The injurer, however, will not have an incentive
to invest $300 as this will only help her save her own litigation costs of
$200.
We see that the social and private incentive to apologize may
diverge. We would expect there to be too many apologies under a
combination of the following circumstances: apologies have a strong effect
on victims’ willingness to forgo parts of their claims, injurer’s own litigation
costs are high, and apologies are cheap. Indeed, there may also be cases
where injurers will have too little incentive to apologize, in which case,
apology laws would be desirable. Which of these two options is more
probable has to do with one’s assessment of the magnitude of the cost of
tendering an apology relative to the effect of apology on the victim. The
stronger the effect, or the lower the cost of apologies, the more we will be
concerned with having too many apologies.
The analysis should not stop here. How would the ability to
apologize affect the decision to undertake the risky activity in the first place?
Tort theory recognizes that injurer’s decision will be affected by how much
the injurer anticipates they would have to pay should an accident occur.
106 Note that at this stage, we do not take into account the possibility that making
the injurer pay will reduce her incentive to harm in the future. The analysis so far is made
‘‘ex-post’’, that is, under the assumption that an accident has already happened.

28 Draft, [8-Sep-16
Under the standard analysis, it is suggested that if the expected payment will
be equal to the harm, the injurer would have optimal incentives.107 With a
sanction equal to the harm, a factory will not produce goods with a value of
$5,000 if the expected harm from a pollution-related accident exceeds
$5,000. Making the factory owner pay $5,000 in the event of an accident
would make sure she would only have an incentive to produce when the
value of the goods exceeds $5,000.
This result changes when we consider apologies. When
contemplating the possibility of an accident, the injurer would take into
account several costs. If no apology is tendered, these costs include the
expected costs of litigation and the costs of liability (e.g., $5,000).108 And
if the injurer decides to tender an apology, then as just analyzed, the injurer
will save some of the costs of litigation and liability, but will have to pay
for the apology itself. In this sense, the cost of delivering the apology can
be thought of as a self-inflicted punishment. Nonetheless, the injurer does
not have to apologize, and she will only do so if the apology is, on net,
privately beneficial. It follows that the injurer will only apologize if she
expects that to reduce her costs. This point emphasizes that the only
potential effect of apologies is to reduce liability.
Part of this reduction in payments is benign, as apologies encourage
settlement of cases that would otherwise litigate. The savings on litigation
due to greater propensity to settle is thus a positive feature of apologies. But
apologies do more than encourage settlements: they also reduce payments
the injurer would have to make to victims. Because the injurer cares about
her own private costs in the event of an accident, this reduction means that
the injurer has less to worry about an accident and less interest to take
precautions against such an accident. Overall, then, apologies dilute
deterrence.
Example 2. Suppose now that a factory owner thinks about using a
production technique that would save $4,000 in production costs-----but will
cause a harm of $5,000 from pollution to one of the neighbors. Suppose, as
before, that apology costs $400 to tender and that it leads to a settlement for

of the Disgorgement Principle in Breach of Contract, 94 YALE L.J. 1339 (1985) (discussing

108 We are assuming, as is conventional, that liability is set to equal the harm, but
not the harm plus litigation costs, See generally A. Mitchell Polinsky & Steven Shavell,
Costly Litigation and Optimal Damages, 37 INT. REV. L. ECON. 86 (2014).

8-Sep-16] Arbel & Kaplan - Draft 29
$2,500, thus saving $200 in litigation costs for both the factory owner and
the neighbor. We have already noted that the factory owner will have an
incentive to apologize in this case. Given that, the factory owner knows that
if she decides to use this production technique, she will gain $4,000 in
savings and her costs from an accident would be $2,900 (apology cost and
the settlement payment). Hence, the factory owner will have an incentive to
undertake the activity, pocketing the $1,100 difference. From a social
perspective, however, the activity causes a harm of at least $5,000 and only
has a benefit of $4,000,109 thus making it undesirable.
Example 2a. Suppose, as in 1a, that the apology costs $300 to tender
and that it does not reduce the amount in settlement. In this case, we have
seen, the injurer will not apologize, hence apologies will not have any
effects on behavior. More generally, if apologies are very costly to make,
they will not influence behavior.
Tying the analysis together, apologies may lead to unwanted
behavior when they are cheap and effective. After an accident, there may
be an excessive incentive for the injurer to apologize. This concern will be
most pressing when, among other things, apologies are cheap and effective
in terms of their effect on victims’ demands in settlement negotiations.
Before an accident occurs, apologies would tend to reduce the injurer’s
incentive to take care, a problem that is again most pressing when apologies
are cheap and effective. It should be emphasized that this does not mean
that apologies are always undesirable; if the apology reduces the cost of an
accident to the injurer by less than the savings it entails in litigation costs to
both parties, it is desirable. However, once the effect of an apology exceeds
that amount, apologies are no longer socially desirable, as the
encouragement of risky behavior exceeds the value of saving on litigation
costs. The main conclusion here is worth repeating: if apologies are cheap
and effective (in terms of reducing the amounts victims ask for), they are
undesirable.
The analysis also carries a strong normative message. The law
influences the ‘‘cost’’ of apologies, because making them privileged reduces
their downside, thus making them cheaper. The literature showed no
appreciation to the notion that there is a benefit to the cost of apologies and
that there may be excessive apologies. Because of that, the central theme in
the literature is that apologies should unconditionally be made cheaper --- an
idea that should be rejected on grounds of public safety. The analysis further
109 To be precise, the total harm given an apology is $5,800, which includes the
litigation costs of both parties and the cost of tendering the apology.

30 Draft, [8-Sep-16
suggests that there is an optimal level of cost of apologies: to the extent that
legislators can influence apology costs, they should set apology costs cheap
enough to encourage apologies to reflect the savings from litigation costs,
but no more than that.
B. Commercial Apologies in Practice
For individuals, sorry may be the hardest word. But when
commercial players enter the arena and the stakes are high, the balance of
costs and benefits of apologies changes.110 As the theoretical framework
highlights the importance of the costs of apologies, we move now to
illustrate how these costs tend to be (relatively) low or are on the decline,
through four different mechanisms.
1. Delegation & Specialization
When an individual tries to render an apology, she is limited by her
own abilities. If she is a bad communicator, seems insincere, or is
uncharismatic, then she may easily botch the apology. She only has herself
to work with; it will normally not do for her to send someone else to
apologize on her behalf.111 With commercial apologies, the situation is
markedly different. Corporations, by necessity, always delegate their tasks
to individuals. The ability to delegate confers on corporations an advantage
in apologizing, as it allows them some leeway in the choice of the individual
to tender the apology.112 By selecting the best apologizers, a firm’s apology
can be made as good as its best employee. This can be crucial, as different
individuals have remarkably different abilities when it comes to apologies.
Here, the BP oil spill case is especially illustrative. After having recognized
that the CEO apology did not go over well,113 the company realized that its
apology is ineffective because the CEO was not an American and thus was
110 See, e.g., Yonathan A. Arbel, Contract Remedies in Action: Specific
Performance, 118 W. VA. L. REV. 369, 398-99 (Finding that animosity plays a lesser role
between commercial parties).
111 See, e.g., Holley S. Hodgins and Elizabeth Liebeskind, Apology versus Defense:
Antecedents and Consequences, 39 J. EXPERIMENTAL SOC. PSYCHOL. 297, 310 (2003).
112 In some cases, it may be expected that the CEO or a specific employee will make
the apology. But it seems that in practice most corporate apologies are delivered various
other employees, including customer representatives.
113 See O’hara supra note 11, 1985.
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2835482
8-Sep-16] Arbel & Kaplan - Draft 31
not viewed as part of the affected group.114 The company pivoted and
delegated the task of apologizing to local, ethnically diverse employees,
who were members of communities affected by the spill.115 BP ran
television ads featuring these employees representing the company, who
clearly identified themselves as locals to the Gulf Coast area and
communicated their personal grief as a result of the accident.116
Certain social expectations may be seen as constraining corporate
leeway in delegate apology tasks, such as the expectation that the
apologizing party will be the wrongdoer (say the attending physician) or that
the CEO will assume residual responsibility in the spirit of President
Truman’s famous plaque ‘‘the buck stops here’’.117 On reflection, however,
this constraint leaves much slack. In many corporate settings, each action
of the corporate is a composite of many different actions and decisions taken
by a diffused mass. There is no natural way to assign blame to a single
employee for a defective automobile coming out of the assembly line. This
entails that there will not be any natural person from whom to demand the
apology. Likewise, some medical procedures involve one physician, but
many involve more than one, which allows the hospital to make a choice
between the medical personnel. Even apologies by corporate leaders leave
room for discretion, as the company can hire managers that are especially
adept at apologizing and may create corporate positions that are mostly
symbolic to fulfill functions such as PR, social responsibility, and apologies.
Finally, Commercial entities are not even limited to their current staff. They
can, and routinely do, retain specialized experts for the management of
crises, such as mediators, actors, and celebrities. A company may choose
to install, for example, a personable CEO in times of crisis. Likable
employees have significant effect; as one medical malpractice practitioner
reported patients ‘‘never sue the nice, contrite doctors. Their patients never
call our offices.’’118

2. Professionalization & Training
To be effective, an apology needs to be, or at least appear to be,
sincere. However, sincerity is never observed, only inferred --- the victims
cannot look into the psyche of the injurer and must rely on signals and
heuristics. By studying these heuristics using modern scientific methods, a
body of scholarship developed that focuses on identifying and exploiting
their weaknesses. Experts have shown, for example, how injurers can
structure apologies for maximal effect by leveraging in-group bias,119 using
effective language,120 choosing the right employees for the task, 121 and
timing apologies correctly.122
These lessons are transferred to commercial actors by specialized
firms through seminars and workshops. These firms help organizations
implement apologies as part of their workflow, suggest ways to streamline
the process of apologies, and offer best practices.123 One such example is
Sorry Works!—an advocacy organization and a training company—claiming
to have “trained thousands of healthcare, insurance, and legal professionals
from coast to coast and around the world” on how to use disclosure and
the Apology, 81 MICH. B.J. 11 (2002) (recounting the story of a client who said that an
apology would substitute a lawsuit).
119 For example, Erin O'Hara suggests that corporate wrongdoers may use local
spokespeople in their apologies, to maximize effect. O’Hara, supra note 11, at 1986 (noting
that the corporate apology was ineffective because the CEO has “thick British accent” which
“probably exacerbated the negative connotations of his resentful statements because it
pegged him and the company as foreign”)
120 See, e.g., Ameeta Patel & Lamar Reinsch, Companies Can Apologize: Corporate
Apologies and Legal Liability, 66 BUS. COMMUN. Q. 9, 21-22 (arguing that corporations can
reap the benefits of apologies with diminished legal exposure by switching from active
language—“I am sorry for hurting you”—to passive language—“I am sorry you were hurt”).

apology to combat medical malpractice suits.124 The experience of the “3Rs
Program” instituted by the physician-trust COPIC is another telling example:
As part of the program, physicians are coached on effective apologies,
training them on timing, structure, and content.125
The professionalization and training in the area of apologies give
commercial actors a unique advantage. They allow these commercial actors
to apologize more effectively and at a lower cost, benefitting from the
accumulated knowledge and experience.
3. Diffusion of Responsibility
Commercial entities enjoy a psychological advantage, as the
psychological cost for the employee to deliver the apology tends to be lower
than that of delivering a personal one. Psychologists argue that an effective
apology requires a person to create the impression of separate parts of her
personality-----a past offender, who committed a wrong and is thus worthy of
scorn, and a present repentant apologizer, who deserves forgiveness.126 This
is a challenging task because the more one accepts responsibility, the more
she might inspire indignation, whereas assuming too little responsibility
may be taken as a failure to take ownership of the wrongdoing. For a
diffused commercial entity, this difficulty may be less severe, because the
party apologizing and the party at fault are not necessarily the same person.
We have noted above how corporate actions are a composite of many
different decisions of various individuals, which dilutes the responsibility of
every single actor. To the extent that the party apologizing and the victim
are not the same, the dissociation makes it much easier to apologize. First,
because it is always easier to admit that someone else was wrong rather than
oneself,127 and second, because the offender may be cast in a bad light

Effects of Apology Versus Denial For Repairing Competence- Versus Integrity-Based Trust
Violations, 89 J. APPL PSYCHOL. 104 (2004). A famous articulation of this idea is by
sociologist Erving Goffman, writing: “an apology is a gesture through which an individual
splits himself into two parts, the part that is guilty of an offense and the part that dissociates
itself from the delict and affirms a belief in the offended rule", ERVING GOFFMAN,
RELATIONS IN PUBLIC 113 (1971). On the relationship between apology and guilt, see Bruce

without negative implications for the image of the apologizing party.128
For example, when Mary Barra, GM’s CEO, took office she
immediately had to start apologizing for the company’s faulty ignition
switches incident---a horrible accident that claimed the lives of 124
individuals.129 Barra had no personal role in the incident, and therefore she
was able to apologize profusely without admitting any personal fault (or
harming her reputation); indeed, she apologized so effectively that she was
heaped with praise at her congressional hearing: ‘‘God bless you, and you’re
doing a good job’’ replied Senator Baxter to Barra’s apology.130 Even in a
closer case, such as BP’s oil spill, CEO Tony Hayward was not personally
responsible for the explosion; the company claimed that it was mostly its
subcontractors who were to blame, and even though the court found the
company was grossly negligent, the blame is not rested solely with the
CEO.131
4. Corporate Culture
Scholars studying corporate culture and crisis management argue
commercial actors have more options than individuals. As William Benoit noted: “It may be
possible to limit damage by firing one or more employees, but Hugh Grant cannot fire
himself”, WILLIAM L. BENIOT, ACCOUNTS, EXCUSES, AND APOLOGIES: A THEORY OF IMAGE
RESTORATION STRATEGIES 48 (2015).
128 An unexpected advantage commercial entities have is related to the
standardization of apologies. It may seem that spontaneous apologies are more powerful than
scripted ones. If this were the case, corporations might have been limited in their ability to
control the provision of apologies. However, research shows that strict guidelines actually
result in more effective apologies. One study finds that apologies by the call center for
reservation or billing mistakes have strong and significant effect on consumer satisfaction.
See Anna S. Mattila & Daniel J. Mount, The Role of Call Centers in Mollifying Disgruntled
Guests, 44 CORNELL HOTEL RESTAUR. ADM. Q. 75 (2003). In another large qualitative study,
researchers in the area of marketing found that corporations with stricter guidelines and rules
on apologies and complaint management result in greater consumer satisfaction and sense of
justice. See Christian Homburg & Andreas Fürst, How Organizational Complaint Handling

that before the 1990s, commercial apologies were seen as stigmatizing.132
The 1990s saw a deep change in the stigma and reputational effects of
commercial apologies. The reasons are complex and many explanations are
offered:133 the creation of a broader ‘‘new culture of apology’’,134 the rise
of the internet, and the introduction of relationship management strategies
in the 1990s.135 Another potential driver of these changes is the discovery
in the marketing literature of the ‘‘recovery paradox’’, whereby apologizing
may actually improve consumer relations relative to their level prior to the
adverse incident.136 Whatever the true explanation is, experts see a strong
change in the way apologies are treated today relative to the 1990s.137 Today
the ‘‘[c]onventional wisdom’’ among scholars in business administration and
branding ‘‘holds that public apology in response to accusations of corporate
misconduct is one of the most important ways to restore a company's
reputation’’.138 Today the default has reversed, and it is expected that
companies would apologize: if in the past only the guilty apologized, today
not apologizing is a violation of consumers’ expectations.139 Moreover,

apologies are taken to be a sign of strength and leadership.140 An employee
would thus find the personal costs of apologizing much lower than in the
past; institutions, like hospitals and insurance companies, often provide a
support system, assuring the injurer an apology is the right and honorable
thing to do. The increased popularity of apologies makes their social cost
lower, as the reputational effect is diminished (and per the recovery
paradox, actually becomes positive).
C. Effectiveness of Commercial Apologies
Commercial actors, we just argued, enjoy important advantages with
respect to tendering apologies. It is, therefore, natural to doubt whether
these apologies have an effect on victims. Would not individuals reject
apologies in commercial settings, seeing them as strategic, profit-
maximizing decisions? Would not the making of repeated apologies by the
same institution adulterate their effect?
In fact, commercial apologies are highly effective. Researchers
studying commercial entities in online settings puzzlingly noted after finding
strong effects that it seems ‘‘as if customers do not realize that they are
interacting with an employee who is paid to send apology emails and not
with an individual who experiences shame when apologizing.’’141 The
researchers concluded their field test by noting that ‘‘[we] find that a cheap-
talk apology yields significantly better outcomes for the firm than offering
a monetary compensation.’’142 The effectiveness of commercial apologies
can be learned from their prevalence,143 but it would be useful to look at
more direct evidence, which also gives a sense of the magnitude of the
effect.
The best evidence comes from the healthcare industry, which is the
best-studied area of commercial apologies, due to the large stakes involved
and the tragic frequency of accidents.144 Starting in the 1990s, hospitals

became aware that many patients sue for emotional reasons, as they resent
the lack of apology.145 This realization led to a series of successful
experiments with institutionalizing apologies.146 An example is the pioneer
program of The University of Michigan Health System. The university
adopted a policy of disclosure and apology that required hospital personnel
and physicians to disclose mistakes and apologize for them. A detailed
before-after analysis of this program reveals significant effects. First, the
monthly rate of claims (defined as requests for monetary compensation) has
fallen by 36%.147 This means that about one-third of the victims gave up
their claims in their entirety. Second, the number of lawsuits has fallen by
65%.148 Third, the cost per lawsuit has fallen from $405,921 to $228,308,
a saving of $177,603 (44%). Fourth, the costs of lawsuits have not only
fallen due to savings on legal costs; the hospital saved about 59% of the
compensation costs it would have had to pay patients.149
Another example is COPIC, an insurance trust founded by
physicians that designed the ‘‘3Rs Program’’: Recognition of the patient’s
harm, Response to the issue in a timely manner, and Resolution-----through
apology and a small offer of compensation. Looking at the data, the offers
of compensation are indeed small: in most cases, no payment is made at all
and in the rest, the payment is for only $5,300.150 The program led to
striking results-----a reduction of 50% in the number of malpractice claims

against COPIC physicians and a reduction in the costs of payments in
settlement of 23%.151 In one of the case records, a 66-year-old patient
suffered from an error that led to the removal of part of her ureter, which
required a painful invasive procedure for its treatment. The program settled
the entire case by paying her $3,898 to account for her out-of-pocket
expenses and, ‘generously’, also for her ‘‘gardening/lawn bills’’.152 These
two apology programs reduced significantly the number of compensation
requests, the number of lawsuits, and, most importantly for our purposes,
the amounts paid to patients.
Looking more broadly, economists Benjamin Ho and Elaine Liu find
that commercial apologies are highly effective. The two have investigated
how apology safe-harbor laws affect malpractice lawsuits. Their studies are
based on the fairly innocuous assumption that apology laws increase the
frequency of apologies. Because of that, if we see a change in outcomes
following the legislation of an apology law, that change would be
attributable to the effect of apologies. Based on this methodology, they find
that a state that adopts an apology law sees a reduction of about 17% in
payments for severe medical injuries,153 which is equivalent to a reduction in
payments of $58,00-73,000.154 This is remarkable, as the averages come
from all hospitals—not necessarily those who instituted an apology policy—
which suggests that the real effect can be much larger. Consistent with that,
a recent working paper found that apology laws lead to a reduction of $65,000
in payments to victims across all injury levels.155
Apologies in a commercial setting are effective beyond the medical
context. In a vignette study, researchers found that consumers express
greater willingness to purchase from companies which apologized in a way
that was perceived as sincere.156 In the commercial context of housing,

of tenants were more likely to accept a settlement offer for an infraction of
landlord’s duties if they were told that the landlord apologized.157 These
results seem to carry over to the market: in market settings, e-apologies led
disappointed consumers to retract unfavorable reviews, at a rate much
greater than when they were offered monetary settlements.158 Moreover,
firms are said to perform better in the stock market after taking
responsibility for past failures.159
III. CRITICAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
The normative framework we provide in Part Error! Reference

note that this effect failed to reach statistical significance. Nonetheless, the size and sign of
the effect are consistent with our argument).
158 On eBay, customers can leave negative responses which can later be withdrawn
if seller’s feedback satisfies the consumer. A group of researchers collaborated with a very
large seller and randomly modified its response to a negative review left by a customer on
transactions with average value of 23.5 Euros: small monetary compensation (2.5 Euro);
large monetary compensation (5 euros), and an apology, electronically delivered by one of
the employees, without admitting to any legal liability and without any monetary
compensation. They found that small monetary compensation yields forgiveness (i.e.,
retraction of the negative review) in 19.3% of the cases; doubling the amount of
compensation only slightly increases forgiveness to 22.9%. The tender of apology outdid
both measures, with a forgiveness rate of 44.8%. See Abeler, supra note 141, 234.
159 Consider, for example, the Domino’s 2009 crisis, when a disgruntled employee
publicized a video of himself committing what we can euphemistically call “health code
violations” of customers’ pizzas. Soon after, Twitter was flooded with tweets deriding the
company and its products. Patrick Doyle, the company’s President, uploaded a response
video to YouTube, in which he said that he is sickened by the act, apologized and reported
corrective action. See Domino's President Responds to Prank Video, YOUTUBE (June 3,
2010) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dem6eA7-A2I. An empirical analysis of 20,773
tweets discovered that this was highly effective and the corporate brand, as reflected by
tweets, was restored to its original levels, See Hoh Kim et al., The Effect of Bad News and
CEO Apology of Corporate on User Responses in Social Media., 10 PLOS ONE e0126358
(2015). Others in the field reflected similar appreciation of the effectiveness of this apology,
and although far from being necessarily causally related, the brand is thriving. Domino’s
stock price is about ten times its value in 2009 . On firms’ performance, see Don Chance,
James Cicon, and Stephen P. Ferris, Poor Performance and the Value of Corporate Honesty,

implications unless certain conditions are met. We have also shown that
commercial apologies are both cheap to tender and highly effective. In light
of this, we move to critically analyze the movement that transformed the
law and to outline necessary policy changes in response to this reform.
A. Better Sorry than Safe
Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that apologies are socially
undesirable if they are relatively cheap to tender and if they have strong
effects on the amounts victims seek. When these conditions obtain, the
problem is that sophisticated commercial actors would be able to anticipate,
before they engage in dangerous activities, that an apology would reduce
their exposure to liability for any ensuing accidents. Because of that, they
would have less incentive to be careful, which may increase the level of
accidents. Hence, they would find it preferable to be sorry rather than safe.
Indeed, if apologies are costly to tender or only mildly effective, this
concern does not arise. However, we believe our analysis above strongly
suggests the possibility of a problem, as commercial apologies are likely to
be both effective and cheaper to deliver in commercial settings. To
illustrate, in one case, a patient was willing to settle after the apology simply
because she felt the hospital took her case seriously.160 The hospital, on the
other hand, saved an approximate $3 million in liability payments in a
lawsuit that, according to the hospital’s estimation, was highly likely to
win.161 Of course, the apology itself had some cost, but nothing in the
evidence indicates this cost was large; indeed, this case is touted for its cost-
saving effect.162
A clear prediction that follows from our analysis is that apology laws
will increase the level or severity of accidents in states that adopt them
relative to non-apology laws states. This is in contrast to the hypothesis of
the Legal Apologists, which stipulates that apology laws will reduce levels
of litigation without a corresponding increase in the level of accidents. The
implications of our prediction are disconcerting. If commercial injurers can
easily escape liability, they would not have a real incentive to be safe. A
food company may employ less quality assurance procedures, a hospital
may order less expensive tests, and a large polluter may install fewer filters
and smoke scrapers than otherwise. To assess the validity of each
hypothesis, we need empirical data; unfortunately, the empirical data we

have from the two studies on the topic is inconclusive, although it is largely
consistent with our prediction.
The most rigorous analysis to date was conducted by economists Ho
and Liu, who looked at the effect of apology laws on the level of disposed
medical malpractice claims.163 They find that apology laws increase the
number of disposed claims involving severe injuries by 21-27% and that
payments for severe injuries increase by 20-28%. This would seem to
suggest a rise in accidents and their severity, but the problem is that the data
consists only of disposed cases and the definition of disposed cases makes
it hard to draw any conclusions. In fact, Ho and Liu argue that the rise is
mostly attributable to the greater speed of processing claims and that over
time, there are fewer claims.164 But this conclusion is constrained by the
meaning and interpretation of disposed claim, a problematic category that
only includes complaints with positive money payments and so it does not
include all, if not most, of the accidents or all the cases where no payment
was made.165 Another limitation is that it is possible to make unreported
payments, and some hospitals seem to be doing so.166
Another problem is the tension between their findings and those of
another, more recent working paper.167 In this study, researchers obtained
data from an insurer that accounts not only for disposed claims with positive
payments, but for all claims that were filed with the insurer. Indeed, this
does not account for accidents that do not result in a formal claim, but it
163 Benjamin Ho & Elaine Liu, Does Sorry Work? The Impact of Apology Laws on
Medical Malpractice, 43 J. RISK UNCERTAIN. 141 (2011).
164 They indeed find that over time apology law states see a significant reduction in
disposed claims for non-severe injuries, but they also find an increase in the level of severe
injuries, which they interpret as resulting from a staggered effect of the apology law.
However, these findings are also consistent with the theory that apology laws increase the
severity of accidents. Id. at 162.
165 This is especially a problem, since most cases are disposed without payment, see
McMichael, supra note 10, at 16 (“Analysis of our data indicates that excluding claims that
involved no payment to a claimant results in excluding over half of all malpractice claims.”)
166 See Teninbaum, supra 40, at 316-17 (discussing rules in an apology program
that are designed to circumvent reporting requirements). See also Amitabh Chandra,
Shantanu Nundy, and Seth A. Seabury, The Growth Of Physician Medical Malpractice
Payments: Evidence From The National Practitioner Data Bank, HEALTH TRACKING, May
31, 2005 (estimating underreporting in data of about 20% of malpractice payments).
167 See McMichael, supra note 10.

does provide a broader approach to the issue.168 The authors of the study
find that apology laws reduce payments to patients by 82%, which is
equivalent to a reduction of $65,000 in the average payment.169 They
explain this result as driven mostly by the increase of claims that do not
result in payment. In other words, they find that apologies mainly increase
the level of claims where no payment is made, but do not affect the level of
payments in other cases. They also find, however, that claims are more
likely to turn into a lawsuit under apology laws-----which is clearly
inconsistent with the goals of apology laws. Both these studies provide much
needed insight, but they do not clearly illuminate the key variable of
interest: the level of accidents. The lack of more focused research is
potentially attributable to the misunderstanding of the potential negative
effect of apologies on incentives, and we hope that this Article will spur
future research in this area.
B. The Paradox of Excessive Apologies
At the heart of the apology law reform is the argument that injurers
are wary of apologizing due to the legal ramifications of exposing
themselves to liability.170 To overcome this fear-----the argument goes-----
apologies should be privileged, shielding injurers from the evidentiary
implications of potential admission of fault. The Legal Apologists argue that
privileging apologies would encourage injurers to apologize, thus leading to
important benefits, most importantly, the control of litigation costs.171
This statement involves a potential paradox with no easy resolution.
The first argument-----that injurers do not apologize for fear of legal
liability-----assumes that unprivileged apologies encourage litigation. But at
the same time, the main reason that Legal Apologists argue that apologies
are desirable is that they encourage settlement and therefore discourage
litigation. It is seemingly paradoxical to argue that apologies both encourage
and discourage litigation. Resolving this paradox comes at a price.
For example, perhaps unprivileged apologies have disparate effect;
they reduce the incentive to bring suit but increase the probability that the
victim will prevail in a lawsuit by having better evidence. While coherent,

171 See supra note 22.

8-Sep-16] Arbel & Kaplan - Draft 43
this resolution also raises problems. It is unclear why the evidentiary
advantage of apologies does not entice more victims to file lawsuits. More
importantly, if privileging apologies will not reduce the level of litigation
but will only reduce the likelihood that the victim will prevail, then
apologies lose much of their luster.
Another possibility is to argue that apologies have a heterogeneous
impact on victims. Some victims will sue unless they receive an apology,
so apologies would reduce litigation in their case and are thus desirable.
Other victims would only sue if they receive an apology (as the apology will
provide them with sufficient evidence) and for this class of victims,
privileging apologies will reduce litigation costs. While coherent, this
resolution is also problematic, as it omits the class of victims who would
sue even in the presence of an apology. Privileging apologies will reduce
the likelihood that this class of victims will prevail in litigation, and thus
involves a cost.172 Whether this cost exceeds the benefit of controlling
litigation from the other group is an empirical question, which admits the
possibility that apologies will be undesirable.
C. Apology as Disclosure
A recurrent narrative, especially among medical professionals, is
that apologies help because they facilitate the communication of mistakes,
as put by Clinton and Obama:
Under our proposal, physicians would be given certain
protections from liability within the context of the
program, in order to promote a safe environment for
disclosure. By promoting better communication, this
legislation would provide doctors and patients with an
opportunity to find solutions outside the courtroom.173
On this account, privileging apologies would mean that injurers
would be more willing to admit their mistakes. The reason why admitting
172 To be clear, injurers would save a corresponding amount, as they would be
more likely to prevail in litigation. However, if we make the (natural) assumption that the
likelihood of prevailing at trial corresponds to the culpability of the injurer, then privileging
apologies would benefit mostly with culpable injurers, thus undermining deterrence.
173 See Clinton and Obama, supra note 1, at 2207.

44 Draft, [8-Sep-16
mistakes is important is an instrumental one; by recognizing mistakes, the
parties can learn and do better in the future.174
This logic may be applicable in many interpersonal settings, but it
transfers poorly to a commercial environment. Before touching on this
point, it should be noted that the basic assumption here --- that mistakes are
not divulged due to liability-----is doubted by many who believe the main
causes for hiding mistakes are factors such as culture and social norms,175
and indeed, studies comparing the rate of disclosure of errors in the United
States and countries with lower levels of liability for medical malpractice
find no difference in error reporting in hospitals.176 Adeeper problem is the
assumption that once identified, mistakes will be corrected. In many
commercial settings, learning from one’s mistakes is not simple. Taking
precautions will often involve investment in machinery, staff, and strict
regulation. These costs can be very high-----consider the cost of purchasing
an MRI machine or even of standard bloodwork procedures if done on a
large scale-----and it will certainly be contradictory to our approach in most
other areas of law to believe that actors will have sufficient incentive to
internalize the costs of their actions without the threat of any legal action.177
This inconsistency was noted by David Hyman and Richard Silver:
[I]t is naïve to think that error reporting and health care quality
would improve automatically by removing the threat of
liability. . . . No statistical study shows an inverse correlation
between malpractice exposure and the frequency of error
reporting, or indicates that malpractice liability discourages
providers from reporting mistakes.178

D. The Deficit of Apology Deficit
Motivating the entire movement of the Legal Apologists is the belief
in an apology deficit. The concern is that injurers have too little incentive
to apologize and therefore they need encouragement. It may seem odd in
retrospect, but besides anecdotal evidence, the point that there is a deficit
in apologies was never proven. Do we really have a deficit of apologies?
Are commercial actors shying away from apologizing?
The core problem is that even without any reform, commercial
injurers should have a strong incentive to apologize. As we have noted,
apologies create value to injurers by suppressing their litigiousness. If
apologies are value-creating, then just like any other goods, profit-
maximizing companies would seek to ‘‘produce’’ them. Indeed, given the
many benefits Legal Apologists ascribe to apologies, it would be odd if
companies would not provide them. The literature is in agreement that there
is a marked transition among companies from the age of ‘‘deny and defend’’
to ‘‘apologize and settle’’.179 Today, commentators agree, commercial
apologies have become commonplace.180 As early as 2002, well before most
states adopted apology laws, a survey of hospital risk managers revealed
that 68% would respond to a mistake with an apology, which suggests a
broad appreciation of the commercial benefits of apologies.181
Psychiatrist Aaron Lazare conducted a casual empirical analysis to
develop a basic intuition of the prevalence of commercial apologies, by
looking at the discourse on apologies in the media.182 To expand his
analysis, we reanalyzed the data using a larger database. Consistent with his
findings, Figure 1 illustrates the findings on the basis of a broad range of
media reports acquired from the EBSCO database, which includes 25
million media articles from the relevant time period.183 As can be seen, until

the 90s, apologies were hardly considered in the media. But starting in the
90s, there has been a growing interest that persists till today.

Overall, the consensus in the literature on the ‘‘age of apologies’’ is
well reflected in this analysis. While this does not amount to a rigorous
analysis of the topic, it does suggest that the apology deficit may not exist.
E. Policy Implications
The on-going tort reform through apology laws is politically and
legally problematic. There are currently calls to further expand the ambit
of apology laws,184 and to encourage mediators and arbitrators, judges, and
juries to account for them.185 If past success and momentum are any

publications, in the English language, between 1971 and 2015. A total of 4967 results were

is produced today than in the past, we validated our findings by limiting search to the New
York Times, the Economist, New York Times Magazine, and the New Yorker – all existing

8-Sep-16] Arbel & Kaplan - Draft 47
indication, these calls are likely to be translated into legislation in the near
future. Our analysis suggests that the case presented by reformists is lacking
in theoretical and empirical support. There is a question whether there is an
apology deficit and there is a real concern that apologies will be used to
circumvent legal liability for accidents by strategic actors. Politically, we
expressed the concern that apology laws have been used as a covert tort
reform, avoiding public scrutiny. These issues raise a few policy
implications.
First order of business is transparency. Apologies laws should be
understood-----and debated-----in terms of tort reform. The public, advocates,
and legislators, should be made aware of the social effects of apology laws.
This does not mean that apology laws should never be enacted-----the debate
on tort reform is an active one. However, the debate should be conducted
transparently, not in terms of virtue or penance, but in the more real terms
of reducing compensation to victims which may or may not be excessive.186
Second, a moratorium should be placed on all future expansions of
apology safe harbor laws. Besides the political concern, there are the social
concerns. Apology laws make the tender of apologies ‘‘cheaper’’ from the
viewpoint of the injurer, and the analysis demonstrates that reducing the
costs of apologies can lead to socially harmful outcomes, in the form of
risky behavior. The evidence we gathered suggests that this risk is real,
given the effectiveness of commercial apologies and their low cost.
Third, there is a push to encourage judges and juries to show
leniency in their judgments towards remorseful injurers.187 In a sense, these
186 Supporters of tort reform would also benefit from a better recognition of the
effect of apologies. There are many tools in the tort reformers’ toolkit, such as damages
caps, procedural adjustments, and panel screening of cases. Each of these tools has its own
advantages and shortcomings. Compared with damages caps, for example, apology laws
have the disadvantage of being impossible to calibrate. If one thinks that the true harm
from a medical accident is $250,000, then a damages cap at this level could rein in courts.
But the effect of apologies on victims is highly idiosyncratic and it does not allow for easy
corrections. On the other hand, apology laws encourage informal settlements, and this may
have merit of its own. Either way, a candid evaluation of alternatives would be prudent.
187 See, e.g., Bibas & Bierschbach, supra note 17, at 128-29 (advocating lenient
treatment of remorseful offenders). Interestingly, a new study provides preliminary evidence
suggesting that apologies have little effect on judges. See Jeffrey J. Rachlinski, Chris Guthrie
& Andrew J. Wistrich, Contrition in the Courtroom: Do Apologies Affect Adjudication?, 98
CORNELL L. REV. 1189 (2013) (finding in a vignette study that “a defendant's apology in
court is generally ineffective, sometimes counterproductive, and only occasionally

48 Draft, [8-Sep-16
initiatives are even more troublesome than the safe harbor laws, as safe
harbor laws protect apologies that can prevent litigation, but this policy
encourages apologies that do not even have this effect. Indeed, some have
argued that there is a case for treating apologizing defendants more
severely.188 We recognize that it may seem counter-intuitive to treat
remorseful and unremorseful injurers equally,189 but it is important to
remember that our discussion is limited only to commercial actors such as
companies, for whom the expression of remorse is at least suspect. In sum,
there should be a presumption against the preferential treatment of
commercial actors who apologize during trial.
Finally, the questions we raised here touch on important social
policies, but the data we currently have is limited. It will be important for
policymakers to devote funds and grants for studies in this area, and perhaps
there is room to use funding from Obamacare’s special allotment to this
end.190
IV. CONCLUSION
Over the last three decades, apology law reform has swept the
nation. Tort reformers and commercial interests provided funding to a
strong lobby that co-opted the rhetoric and discourse developed by a
movement of legal scholars we called the Legal Apologists. The work of
the Legal Apologists has contributed greatly to our philosophical, social,
and psychological understanding of the role of apologies in both the law and
in our daily lives. However, they have failed to articulate an account of
apologies in commercial settings and have not considered the potentially
socially harmful effects of apologies of this type. This oversight has not
been lost on tort reformers, who advocated apology law reformers to
effectively achieve tort reform through the backdoor.
We argued that making apologies cheaper may lead to socially
harmful outcomes. To support our claims, we developed a new model for
beneficial”).
188 Mungan argues that treating apologies more harshly helps differentiate between
sincere apologies (which are meant to relieve guilt) and non-sincere apologies. See Mungan,
supra note 5, at 179.
189 For the moral argument that it is wrong for the law to treat equally repentant and
unrepentant transgressors, see supra note 61 and accompanying text.

tort liability with apologies, which we used to show that injurers may have
an excessive incentive to apologize if apologies are cheap and effective.
Based on the evidence we gathered, we found that commercial actors
professionalize and institutionalize the tender of apologies and they use them
for great effect. This suggests that apologies may actively undermine
deterrence and lead to risky behavior. On the basis of our analysis, we call
for a moratorium on apology laws and a political and legal revaluation of the
ones that currently exist. Through a transparent and honest assessment of
apology laws, based on an understanding of these laws as means of tort
reform, we can reach informed and democratic decisions on their desirability.
This Article should spark a much needed discussion on apologies,
commercial interests, tort reform, and liability for harms. From an ethical
perspective, there is still much to be said on the ethical value of apologies
by incorporeal entities such as corporations. We are especially hoping that
future empirical research would devote more specific attention to the
relationship between apology laws and medical malpractice.

V. APPENDIX: A MODEL OF LIABILITY FOR ACCIDENTS WITH APOLOGIES
The Legal Apologists argue that apologies curb litigation. However,
they have failed to consider the full implications on ex-ante behavior. In this
Section we provide a model designed to articulate the implications of this
distinction in terms of the social desirability of apologies, with a focus on
the problem of deterrence.
To fit apologies within the framework of the incentive to take care,
we take the conventional model of accidents.191 In the model, a potential
injurer chooses a level of precautions for an activity. These precautions are
costly, but reduce the risk of an accident. If an accident occurs, then the
injurer faces liability for the harm caused by the accident. Alternatively, the
injurer may choose to apologize, which is privately costly (e.g., loss of
face, humiliation, reputation, the time involved, or other psychological
considerations). Making an apology affects the level of liability, because the
victim may be more willing to settle, less interested in litigation, the jury
may be more forgiving, or the judge less likely to attribute fault.
Additionally, there are some administrative costs involved in litigation, such
as the costs of operating the court.192 Because apologies reveal information,
induce settlements, and reduce the necessary expenses on trials, making one
reduces the administrative cost. With this in mind, we introduce the
following notation:
c: cost of precautions (c ≥ 0);
h: harm;
q(c): probability of harm (q(0)=1, q'< 0, q''< 0); 193
T: the injurer’s choice regarding apology: T= 1 if apology is
tendered, T= 0 otherwise;
a: the cost of making an apology;
s(T): social cost of enforcement (s(.) ≥ 0);
l(T): injurer’s liability.
Based on our assumptions, we note that l(0) = h and s(1) < s(0).
191 See Steven Shavell, Liability for Accidents, in HANDBOOK OF LAW &
ECONOMICS, 142, 143-44 (A. Mitchell Polinsky & Steven Shavell eds., 2007).
192 See Shavell, supra note 191, at 150.
193 We make the conventional assumption that precautions reduce the probability of
harm, but that there are diminishing marginal returns to investment in precautions.
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2835482
8-Sep-16] Arbel & Kaplan - Draft 51
To say, the liability for the accident, absent an apology, is equal to the
harm, and the social cost of administering punishments is lower when an
apology is made. Looking ex-post (after harm has occurred), we make the
following argument:
Proposition 1: The private incentive to apologize diverges from the
social interest in apologies. [i] Injurers will have an incentive to apologize
even when it is not socially desirable, and [ii] may fail to apologize even
when an apology is desirable.
Proof:
Consider first the private cost of the activity for the injurer, denoted
as ϕ:
(1) 𝜙 = −𝑐 −𝑞(𝑐)(𝑇𝑎+𝑙(𝑇))
That is, the injurer bears the cost of precautions. If an accident
occurs, the injurer further bears the cost of apology if one is made and the
costs of liability-----which also depend on whether an apology was made.
The injurer will choose to apologize (T = 1) if the cost of the activity
when making an apology (ϕ) is lower than the cost of the activity without
1
one (ϕ):
0
𝜙 < 𝜙 =
1 0
(2) 𝑎 < 𝑙(0)−𝑙(1)
We see that an apology is only privately desirable if it reduces
liability by more than its cost. The social cost of the activity is different. It
consists of the harm to the victim, the cost of enforcement, and also the
costs of the apology, if made:
(3) 𝜃 = −𝑐 −𝑞(𝑐)(𝑇𝑎+ℎ+𝑠(𝑇))
Therefore, apology is socially desirable only if the cost from making
one (θ) is lower than the social costs in its absence (θ):
1 0
𝜃 < 𝜃 =
𝑡 0
(4) 𝑎 < 𝑠(0)−𝑠(1)
This means (from 2 and 4) that the injurer will have an excessive
incentive to apologize whenever:
(5) 𝑠(0)−𝑠(1) < 𝑎 < 𝑙(0)−𝑙(1)
That is, if the cost of apology exceeds it social benefits, but liability
is reduced by a greater amount, the injurer will have an incentive to
apologize when it is socially undesirable. Symmetrically, the injurer will
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2835482
52 Draft, [8-Sep-16
not apologize, even though an apology is socially desirable, if:
(6) 𝑙(0)−𝑙(1) < 𝑎 < 𝑠(0)−𝑠(1)
QED
Proposition 2: If apologies are privately beneficial for the injurer:
[i] the injurer will choose a level of precautions that is lower than the
socially optimal level, [ii] the harms from the activity will be higher than
the social optimum, and [iii] the more favorable is the treatment of apologies
by the legal system, the less care and more harm injurers will create.
Proof:
The injurer chooses the level of precautions based on the expected
costs of the activity, given by (1). When the injurer expects apology to be
a beneficial option for her (from 2) the level of care is given by the first
order condition:
−1
(7) 𝑞′(𝑐) =
𝑎+𝑙(1)
Let 𝑐∗ be the solution to (7). Note that the socially desirable level of
precautions, from (3), is:
−1
(8) 𝑞′(𝑐) =
𝑎+ℎ+𝑠(1)
Comparing the two, we can see that a + l(1) < a + h + s(1). To
see that, recall that an apology is only made if (2) holds, i.e., a < l(0) -
l(1), from which follows directly that l(1) < l(0). Therefore, and because
l(0) = h, it can be shown that l(1) < h. It then follows that the inequality
necessarily holds. Note that this is true even if the injurer would bear the
social cost of enforcement s(1). Even if that was the case, still 𝑎+𝑙(1)+
𝑠(1) < 𝑎+ℎ+𝑠(1), as long as apologies help injurers reduce liability
(𝑙(1) < 𝑙(0) = ℎ). Given the concavity of q, it follows that the solution to
(8) is greater than c*.
To verify [iii], note that the greater the difference between l(0) and
l(1) becomes (i.e., the more favorable treatment to apologizers is given by
the legal system), the more the gap between optimal and actual precautions
increases.
QED
Finally, we consider the possibility some injurers do not apologize,
and the possibility it would be worthwhile to lower liability to encourage
them to apologize.
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2835482
8-Sep-16] Arbel & Kaplan - Draft 53
Proposition 3: Providing preferential treatment to apologies is only
socially desirable if: [i] the costs of apologies currently not rendered are
lower than their benefit of reducing administrative costs, and [ii] the
decrease in the administrative costs is not outweighed by an increase in the
harms from the injurer’s activity.
Proof:
A socially desirable apology will not be made only if (6) holds, so
part [i] follows directly. To verify [ii], note that if (6) holds true, the injurer
will not apologize, and take precautions accordingly. The cost of the activity
for the injurer, from (1), would be:
(9) 𝜙 = −𝑐 −𝑞(𝑐)(𝑙(0))
So that the level of precautions is determined by:
−1
(10) 𝑞′(𝑐) =
𝑙(0)
Let 𝑐∗∗ be the solution to (9). This means that the social cost of the
activity if apology is not given would be:
(11) 𝜃 = −𝑐∗∗ −𝑞(𝑐∗∗)(ℎ+𝑠(0))
0
Conversely, if apology is given, the social cost of the activity is:
(12) 𝜃 = −𝑐∗ −𝑞(𝑐∗)(𝑎+ℎ+𝑠(1))
1
Lowering l(1) to make apology privately beneficial is socially
desirable only if θ< θ.
0 1
(13) −𝑐∗∗ −𝑞(𝑐∗∗)(ℎ+𝑠(0)) < −𝑐∗ −
𝑞(𝑐∗)(𝑎+ℎ+𝑠(1))
Or after rearranging, if:
(14) 𝑞(𝑐∗)(𝑎+𝑠(1))−𝑞(𝑐∗∗)𝑠(0) < 𝑐∗∗ −𝑐∗ +
𝑞(𝑐∗∗)ℎ−𝑞(𝑐∗)ℎ
That is, apology has the benefit of reducing the administrative cost
in the event of an accident. It also has a cost due to the increase in net harm
from the activity, because of the diluted deterrence. The apology is only
desirable if its benefits exceed these costs.

How Smart Are Smart Readers? LLMs and the Future of the
No-Reading Problem
Yonathan A. Arbel & Shmuel I. Becher
Abstract. Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to summarize and simplify
complex texts. In this study, we investigate the extent to which state-of-the-art
models can reliably operate as ‘smart readers’: applications that empower
consumers to tackle lengthy, difficult-to-read, and inaccessible standard form
contracts and privacy policies.
Our analysis reveals that smart readers (1) reduce by 66.9% the length of
contracts; (2) reduce reading time by 14:41 minutes (3) improve text readability
by converting college-level texts to texts readable by fifth-grade students; and (4)
do so without considerably compromising the essential information in the
original contracts. Despite these impressive results, smart readers are not flawless.
They sometimes miscommunicate legal terminology and occasionally present
information in a misleading or erroneous manner. Such issues prevent smart
readers from replacing the advice of a qualified lawyer. However, for the large
mass of daily transactions where consumers would not consider using a lawyer,
current-generation smart readers could be an effective tool. We thus conclude
that current generation smart readers have arrived and that their arrival invites
an academic and policy paradigm change.

ARBEL & BECHER HOW SMART ARE SMART READERS? 3/41
I. INTRODUCTION
An organizing problem in consumer contracts is the no-reading problem.1
The common view in the scholarship is that consumers rarely read standard form
contracts,2 and, therefore, their manifested assent to them is superficial.3 If
consumers indeed do not read (let alone understand) the terms of their
transactions, their ability to make informed decisions is doubtful, and sellers’
incentive to provide fair and efficient contract terms is undermined.4
This chapter evaluates whether smart readers—technological tools that use
large language models (LLMs) to parse texts—can solve this problem and
transform standard form contracting. We evaluate this question by testing
current models on their ability to simplify contractual texts. Testing current
generation models might seem like writing on ice: the rate of technological
improvement is staggering, and whatever results we obtain today will be eclipsed
by tomorrow’s models.5 Yet, we engage in this analysis because we want to
determine if today’s smart readers have already managed to pass a utility
threshold. If today’s smart readers can empower consumers, this would directly
impact the large body of scholarship and policy directed at solving this problem
1 See generally Ian Ayres & Alan Schwartz, The No-Reading Problem in Consumer Contract Law, 66
STAN. L. REV. 545 (2014) (describing the no-reading problem and offering a solution to it); see also
RESTATEMENT OF CONSUMER CONTS. § 3 Reporters’ Notes (AM. L. INST., Tentative Draft 2019) (pointing
out that the terms of standard form contracts are “invisible to most consumers” and discussing how firms
that modify their contracts must give consumers reasonable notice); Melvin Aron Eisenberg, Text Anxiety,
59 S. CAL. L. REV. 305 (1986) (theorizing that when consumers confront the dense text of form contracts,
they respond by refusing to read it).
2 The exact scope of the problem is somewhat contested, but there is at least one domain definitely
afflicted by extremely low levels of readership: online end-user license agreements. See, e.g., Yannis
Bakos, Florencia Marotta-Wurgler & David R. Trossen, Does Anyone Read the Fine Print? Consumer
Attention to Standard-Form Contracts, 43 J. LEGAL STUD. 1, 22 (2014) (finding that consumers rarely read
the terms of end-user license agreements).
3 Victoria C. Plaut & Robert P. Bartlett, Blind Consent? A Social Psychological Investigation of Non-
Readership of Click-Through Agreements, 36 L. & HUM. BEHAV. 293, 293 (2012) (noting the “documented
phenomenon” of “‘blind consent’” — accepting the terms without reading them — associated with
“standard, paper-based contracts” now occurs with online Click-Through Agreements). To be sure, the no-
reading problem presents additional challenges, aside from consent, to consumer contracting, and
consumers’ consent should be doubted for reasons other than the no-reading problem. See, e.g., Michael I.
Meyerson, The Reunification of Contract Law: The Objective Theory of Consumer Form Contracts, 47 U.
MIAMI L. REV. 1263 (1993) (discussing contractual issues in battle of the forms cases where seller includes
a disclaimer of warranty of merchantability that the buyer does not read and highlighting the importance
of informing consumers, even if they do not read or grasp the terms); Margaret Jane Radin, Boilerplate
Today: The Rise of Modularity and The Waning of Consent, 104 MICH. L. REV. 1223 (2006) (discussing
how even if companies make terms easier to read, consumers will not necessarily read them and asserting
that consent is fictional, when, for instance, the terms are filed somewhere inaccessible, as in airline tariffs).
Recent work argues that AI contracting technologies, namely “nano contracts,” will autonomously
negotiate contracts and circumvent the standard negotiation process and its attendant issues. E.g., Yonathan
A. Arbel, On the Scales of Private Law: Nano Contracts, 37 HARV. J. L. & TECH. (forthcoming 2024).

through non-technological means. If they cannot, however, regulation may be
justified in relying on non-technological tools.
To frame our analysis, we offer a brief background on smart readers and their
relevance to the no-reading problem in Section II. In Section III, we describe our
dataset and methodology. We present the results of our examination at the level
of the entire agreement, comparing the complexity, length, readability, and
quality of the legal documents before and after their simplification in Section IV.
Then, in Section V, we shift the focus from the entire legal text to (eight) specific
clauses, allowing for a more in-depth and digestible analysis of the models’
capabilities, advantages, and limitations.
In Section VI, we discuss the key insights of this study. We find that smart
readers perform well on both quantitative and qualitative metrics. They cut in
half text difficulty, shorten long texts considerably, and generally capture the
most important or intricate aspects of the original texts they simplify. Yet, smart
readers also struggle with some types of clauses and sometimes understate, omit,
or provide incorrect information on some contractual aspects. In all, smart
readers do not replace the careful eye of an experienced lawyer, but they can
address consumer problems at scale, cheaply, efficiently, and effectively. In other
words, we find that smart readers have arrived.
II. SETTING THE SCENE: LLMS & THE NO-READING PROBLEM
While most scholars believe that consumers do not read form contracts and
privacy policies (the “no-reading problem”), the reason for this phenomenon is
not quite settled. Why do consumers abstain from reading? Scholars have offered
several explanations. Some focus on rational apathy, with not reading emerging
as a rational strategy considering the immediate and real costs of reading against
the uncertain future gains of doing so. Consumers may also misperceive contract
terms or ignore them altogether if they are prone to myopia, information
overload, or other forms of behavioral biases.6 The take-it-or-leave-it nature of
most form contracts also makes reading unattractive for negotiation purposes.7
Other explanations for consumers’ tendency to not read form contracts relate to
6 See OREN BAR-GILL, SEDUCTION BY CONTRACT: LAW, ECONOMICS, AND PSYCHOLOGY IN
CONSUMER MARKETS (Oxford Univ. Press 2012).
7 See Nat’l Lab. Rels. Bd. v. Gen. Elec., 418 F.2d. 716, 768 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 965
(1970) (characterizing a “take-or-leave-it” approach as a “hard position” that “may be unattractive").

reputational constraints, trust and social norms, and a (sometimes misguided)
belief in the courts’ reluctance to enforce unreasonable terms.8
However, perhaps the most influential accounts relate to the writing itself.
Consumer form contracts are cognitively taxing, visually difficult, and replete
with blocks of off-putting ALL-CAPS while employing arcane terms, complex
language, and difficult concepts.9 Consumers do not read contracts, in short,
because reading them is a miserable experience.10
These challenges lead to a central problem in unregulated markets. Namely,
if consumers do not read forms and the law generally allows them to proliferate,
firms can insert self-serving terms without losing demand.11 This situation gives
rise to a winning strategy we dub HIDE. Under HIDE, firms adopt forms that
are “Hardly Interpretable but Dependably Enforceable.” The HIDE strategy
allows firms to benefit from both worlds: maximizing their share of the
transactional surplus while reaping the benefits of legal enforcement.12
To deal with HIDE and increase the legitimacy of consumer form contracts,
scholars, regulators, courts, and advocates have sought solutions to make
contracts more readable and accessible and consumers’ assent less questionable.
Courts, in a perhaps naïve attempt to incentivize consumers to read, often
impose a so-called duty to read.13 At the same time, lawmakers around the
country have instituted hundreds of plain language laws.14 The UCC famously
conditions enforcement of warranty disclaimers on their formatting and

presentation;15 the Magnuson-Moss Act16 controls language in disclaimers; the
Truth in Lending Act (TILA)17 controls both presentation and language. Agency
action is also involved. For instance, the CFPB recently published new guidelines
on what counts as abusive behavior, which includes ‘buried disclosures’ broadly
understood to include ‘the use of fine print, or complex language’.18
Such regulations cover broad markets and are quite influential. A prominent
example comes from insurance markets. Here, some states and government
agencies have adopted not only plain language requirements but also required
specific scores on reading metrics, such as the Flesch-Kincaid readability metric.19
While well-intentioned, these policies have an uneasy fit to those anonymous
mass transactions that typify the consumer experience. Consumers are diverse,
and their cognitive and linguistic skills, education, socioeconomic status, life
experience, expectations, and visual acuity can differ significantly. Millions of
American adults struggle with literacy, for diverse reasons.20 The idea of plain
language homogenizes consumers, supposing that a single serving of simpler
words can address the needs of a diverse group. But, in reality, such reforms come
at a cost and do not necessarily help those who need protection most. At the
same time, writing legal texts that would be readable by those with low literacy
is a challenge to the best of writers. Furthermore, plain language efforts often do
not address the issue of length: consumers are likely to avoid reading plain
language contracts if their length is excessive, and few regulatory frameworks
limit the length of legal texts.
Enter smart readers. In 2021, we noticed that the emergent transformer
technology shows real promise in processing text in general and legal texts in
particular. GPT-2, and later GPT-3, could interact with natural language in ways
not conceivable before. The feasibility of developing smart readers— that is,

advanced large language models (LLMs) capable of parsing, personalizing, and
clarifying legal texts for consumers—is becoming manifestly clear.21
As we demonstrated elsewhere,22 these capabilities mean that, for the first
time, readers could have contracts presented in a way that they could understand.
Instead of serving an abstract average or reasonable consumer, smart readers
could tailor the text to specific, ad-hoc, personalized, or idiosyncratic needs of
the individual user. Most promising, the technology was almost entirely
consumer-sided. The seller was not part of the process, and any HIDE strategy
they might pursue was now challenged. Consumers could have control. Smart
readers could penetrate the dense language thicket; each contract could be
tailored to the individual consumer.
To be sure, the technology in 2021 was nascent. The models we used were
quite clunky and success was sporadic.23 To showcase its potential, we had to
cherry-pick examples, a fact we explicitly noted.24 GPT-3 produced outputs that
were sometimes unreliable and misleading, while other times they were
meandering and irrelevant.25 Understandably, when we presented our work,
commentators were often skeptical. One reason for their skepticism was that the
technology’s inconsistency meant consumers cannot reliably trust it. There were
also understandable concerns about the ability of this technology to separate the
wheat from the chaff, work at scale, parse complex texts, account for specific legal
knowledge, and avoid capture by sellers.
We could not provide hard proof that these issues were temporary. However,
the arc of this technology was clear to those immersed in the technical details of
how it worked. The problems salient back then were true issues, but they related
to insufficient data and compute resources,26 rather than a missing intellectual
breakthrough. At the fundamental level, it was clear that these issues were
transient.

taker. It passed other bars as well. GPT-4 has blazed through the LSAT (88th
percentile) and medical exams (75th percentile).28 It achieved good scores on
challenging economics and advanced quantum physics exams.29 Most
importantly, the sentiment changed. While the technology is imperfect in many
ways, it became apparent that its current achievements do not represent all of its
potential. Indeed, the main question commentators and the public ask today is
not what the technology can do, but what it cannot.30
The rate of mass adoption of ChatGPT has surpassed almost any other
technology or invention.31 Versions of LLMs are now accessible to the end user
free of charge. The technology requires little expertise to use. Most of all, the
technology is impressive. From a law and policy perspective, the time is ripe to
evaluate whether smart readers could empower consumers and solve the no-
reading problem.32

Assessed Criteria: Readability, Length and Quality. Our examination focuses
on three key criteria at the heart of the no-reading problem. First is text
readability. As noted, many suspect that unreadability deters consumers from
reading. Therefore, we sought to examine whether language models can make
consumer form contracts and privacy policies more readable.
The most famous readability measure is the Flesch Ease of Reading test,
which assesses text readability on a 0-100 scale.34 This test was later amended to
convert the scores to a grade-level equivalent, resulting in the Flesch-Kincaid
variant.35 Microsoft users might be familiar with these readability tests, which are
embedded in Word.36 This test is joined by a battery of other tests: Gunning-
Fog, SMOG, Linsear-Write, Automated Readability, and Dale-Chall.37
The common ground shared by these tests is that they abstract from the
meaning strata of the text and evaluate it based on syntactic features, most
commonly sentence length, word syllabicity, and word rarity. These measures
are widely used but have been recently critiqued for their limited reliability and
validity.38 One special concern is that these tests are highly manipulable. By
choosing a different implementation of the Flesch-Kincaid test one could obtain
results that show the same text requires 4.6 extra years of schooling.39 To limit

these issues, we use the Combined Readability Measure (CRM), which measure
averages within implementations of the same test and across a number of
readability measures. This approach smooths test difference and produces results
that are, at the very least, far less manipulable.
The second criterion we assess is text length. Consumer contracts and privacy
policies grow longer over time, and there is reason to believe that lengthy texts
dissuade consumers from reading. Accordingly, we analyzed the language
models’ ability to shorten the sampled eight legal documents.
Finally, even if language models can shorten and simplify legal texts, there is
still the concern that this will come at the expense of meaning and context. In
other words, simplifying a text can result in losing key facts, important details,
nuances, and context. Therefore, our third criterion is text quality. Here, we
sought to evaluate to what extent the simplified summaries captured the
important legal aspects, risks, obligations, and rights.
Simplification tools: challenges, selection, and programming. While some
services offer AI-powered summarization, none specialize in contracts. Aiming
to fully understand and control the summary process presented three technical
challenges. We discuss them in turn.
First, many language models are available to select from and each has different
limitations on context size and a different mode of interaction (aka Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs)). We addressed this issue by selecting the best
models that could be used inexpensively. We believe this simulates well the future
direction of smart readers, where they will not necessarily rely on state-of-the-art
technology to contain costs. The models we picked, however, were all competent
models by today’s standards, and, hence, offer a good representation of current
capabilities. These models came from two firms: Anthropic (Claude) and
OpenAI (ChatGPT).
The second challenge we encountered was that current models have
constraining limits on input length, meaning that we could not process the entire
contract at once. We handled this challenge by developing our own smart reader.
In essence, the code we developed performs the following tasks:
(1) Handle the communication mode with the various models (API);
(2) Code for each model its limitations on input length;
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4491043

<<PAGE_BREAK>>

ARBEL & BECHER HOW SMART ARE SMART READERS? 11/41
(3) Divide the text into ‘chunks’ that fit the input length limitations;40
(4) Define in code our prompt for the task;
(5) Use a new Python library called ‘langchain’;41 the code iteratively asks the
models for simplification of the relevant chunks; and
(6) Use the code to combine the chunks together into the resulting simplified
contract.
The third challenge involved devising a specific prompt that would ensure
our goals as described above: (1) no loss of information, (2) simpler language,
and (3) shorter language. Devising this prompt was arguably the most critical
aspect in our design since the wording of the prompt can radically change the
quality of the output generated by the model. But because there are no robust
prompt optimization algorithms that we could use, we relied instead on trial and
error.
After some experimentation, we decided on the following prompt:
Simplify contract, low Flesch Kincaid score, KEEP MEANING. Use
short words, not legal terms. Swap: accomplishment=success,
responsibility=duty, extravagant=fancy. Keep necessary legal concepts.
Short sentences. Preserve legal aspects. NO COMMENTS.
It is worth noting three points regarding the prompt. First, the prompt was
shorter than we wanted, but it was necessary to keep it short to limit the burden
on the maximum input length. It is possible that a more elaborate prompt would
yield better outcomes. Second, the prompt aims to ensure the model prioritizes
certain objectives using capitalization. Third, the prompt uses a few examples,
which is known to increase model performance.
Analysis. Our analysis proceeds in three phases. First, we test the ability of
smart readers to simplify the contracts and policies using objective metrics. As
detailed in part IV.A, these included length, complexity, and readability. Second,
we assess the quality of the summaries and the extent to which they capture key
information. To that end and as we explain in more detail below,42 we use
Spotify’s Terms of Use as a sample contract and identified specific important
40 Chunking is not a trivial task, since cutting off a document in the middle risks disrupting its meaning.
This risk is especially true for cutting off in the middle of a sentence, but is also true for other cutting
criteria given textual inter-dependence. Our chunking algorithm divided the document into sentences and
then made sure each chunk only had full sentences. A more robust system would have divided the
document into clauses, but besides the technical difficulty of detecting clause limits, even this approach
would cut off inter-clause dependencies.

contractual aspects and possible consumer traps. We then assess the extent to
which two simplification outputs included the issues we spotted in their
summary. Third, we examine in-depth the simplification of eight specific clauses.
Whereas Part V focuses on the high-level results, Part V outlines the analysis
process of the specific terms, its results, and our evaluation.
IV. HIGH-LEVEL RESULTS
We now detail our general results. In Section A, we discuss the simplification
assessments. Using common tools, we objectively measure text length,
complexity, and readability. We supplement these objective metrics in Section
B, where we detail our subjective impression of two of the simplifications and
their ability to capture key information.
A. Simplification Assessment
1. Text Length
We started by measuring the reduction in words. On average and across all
contracts, the various models produced a text that was about 30% of the length
of the original in terms of words. In terms of reading time,43 if the original version
would take on average 20 minutes and 45 seconds to read, the simplified version
only takes 6 minutes and six seconds, a time-saving of 14 minutes and 39
seconds. The following figure summarizes the average effect across all agreements
and models.
43 Based on Marc Brysbaert, How Many Words Do We Read Per Minute? A Review and Meta-Analysis
of Reading Rate, 109 J. MEMORY & LANGUAGE 1, 21 (2019) (the average adult reads at a rate of 238 words
per minute for non-fiction texts and 260 words per minute for fiction ones). As suggested to us by Professor
Tim Samples, the reading time for difficult texts is longer, and by the same source it is estimated as 238
multiplied by 4.6 divided by the mean word length. The following Figure includes this method of analysis.

Figure 4: Text Readability Flesch-KincaidFigure 2: Length Reduction (in
Thousand Words)
Another notable feature of the models is their great variability. Despite
employing a similar prompt, the models produced wildly different results. While
all models did well in terms of summarization, the worst one (Davinci-001) saw
a reduction of 49%, while the best one (Curie-001) decreased 88.4% of the
original length. And while all models perform admirably, the longest version was
three times longer than the shortest one. In other words, there is a large degree
of inconsistency between models.
The following figure aggregates the reduction across all documents to provide
an overview of the average reduction in the number of words and sentences, as
well as the required reading time.

2. Text Complexity
One way to assess the simplification of text is by a count of difficult words in
the text before and after simplification. Although there is no single way to

measure word difficulty, we relied on the word list compiled for a famous

tailored to legal jargon. However, it is adequate for our purposes of assessing
differences between versions (rather than the absolute number of difficult words).
The Figure below shows the number of difficult words in the different
documents. The red bar shows the number of difficult words in the original text
and the purple bar summarizes the average number of difficult words across the
various models. Across all documents, we note an average reduction of 328
difficult words, representing a 61% reduction. As before, there is great model
variability in simplification. Still, even the worst model (DaVinci-001)
substantially reduced the number of difficult words, removing 36% of them.

3. Text Readability
There is more to text readability than difficult words, and the literature on
readability has developed several quantitative tools to measure readability.45 As
discussed above, we report on the results of the famous Flesch-Kincaid score and
the average of a number of readability measures (CRM).46
44 See Common Education Data Standards, supra note 37. We implemented this word list via the
Textstat library in Python.
45 See id. (listing out different readability tests).

As the next figure depicts, the original contracts were written at a level that
requires between 10 and 14 years of schooling on the Flesch-Kincaid measure.47
Figure 4: Text Readability Flesch-Kincaid
On average, LLMs reduced the reading difficulty of the original contracts by
1.47 grade levels. That said, there was great variability among the models, with
the best performing model (Claude-001) reducing the reading level by an average
of 5.6 grade levels, down to a 5.4 grade level. This reduction would make
contracts accessible to 11-year-olds. This improvement is quite important as a
large body of scholarship recommends that reading materials be accessible to
people who read between the sixth to eighth grade level.48
Figure 5 below provides similar numbers with the CRM measure. The
average reduction on the CRM was more modest, with close to a single grade
level. However, here too, the best performing model (Claude-001) did very well
and reduced the reading level by 5 grade years, down to a level close to the
seventh grade (that is, a 6.8 grade level).

Quite surprisingly, despite our prompts, some models have made them more
complex. Yet again, the models have had mixed success in simplifying the
contracts. The most consistent models were Claude-001 and Text-Davinci-003,
a finding consistent with them being the most advanced in our group.
B. Quality Assessment
To develop a better sense of the quality of the outputs generated by LLMs,
we supplemented our metric-based examination above with a more subjective
evaluation. Essentially, we compared the first parts49 of an original text—
Spotify’s Terms of Use—with two simplified outputs, produced by ChatGPT-
Turbo and Claude. Particularly, we sought to examine whether the simplified
versions captured the key issues and points we identified in the original text.
We started by reading the original text and highlighting clauses likely to be
of special importance for unwary consumers. We detected 11 central or tricky
points (dubbed here “traps”). We then read the two simplified versions,
examining whether these versions properly mentioned the identified 11 key
points. We also noted our general subjective impression of the texts’ quality,
presentation, and user-friendliness.
49 By first parts, we mean clauses one to three, which contained 2,360 words.

<<PAGE_BREAK>>

ARBEL & BECHER HOW SMART ARE SMART READERS? 17/41
Overall, we found that both platforms made the contracts much simpler and
captured most of the important information. However, significant differences
were evident between the two outputs in terms of length, visual presentation,
and the use of bullet points. The visual presentation, however, should not be
emphasized. It was more an artifact of the way we coded the smart reader than a
technological challenge. With more resources, we can produce a smart reader
that will organize the text, use bullet points, and even engage in creative design,
including colors and comic-style graphics.
In addressing the 11 traps, both models performed reasonably well, albeit
with somewhat varying degrees of success. Both models captured most, but not
all, traps and important information in their summaries. For example, ChatGPT
Turbo included 9 of the 11 traps in its summary. Interestingly, one of the traps
that Claude omitted overlapped with one of these two missing traps. This finding
has two implications. First, if some models fail to address certain issues, another
model better at detecting them can supplement them (the ‘ensemble’ method).
Second, there is room for research into the possibility that current LLMs might
systematically miss some types of information.
In general, we observe that some of the omissions and presentation issues we
encountered are due to the need to cut the original texts into smaller chunks.
This “chunking” strategy is common today, but it is imperfect.50 It interferes
with the flow of the text and cuts context, an especially important concern in
interdependent contracts. With time, input length will not pose as much of an
issue, so the flaws associated with this specific problem are transient.
This broad review allowed us to develop a general sense of quality. However,
it did not capture some of the subtleties of simplification. To that end, we next
analyzed specific clauses.
V. SIMPLIFICATION & QUALITY: SPECIFIC CLAUSES
To develop a more robust understanding of the capability of smart readers to
produce high-quality simplifications, we next shifted our focus from the entire
contracts to specific clauses within them. We chose to focus on eight specific
terms that may pose challenges for the unsuspecting consumer. That is, rather
than measuring performance on random clauses, some of them potentially trivial,

we actively selected clauses that we thought mattered for consumers. These
included, for example, clauses that address cancelation, information sharing,
liability limitation, dispute resolution, and unilateral modifications.
Because this focus resulted in relatively short texts (i.e., specific clauses), we
could effectively use GPT-4, the current state-of-the-art model. For consistency,
we used the same prompt as before. In what follows, we delineate the contract
clauses we examined. For each clause, we provide the original text, followed by
the simplified version offered by GPT-4. We then evaluate the simplification in
terms of length, complexity/readability, and quality.

Evaluation
This clause allows the service provider to change the terms of the agreement
unilaterally, an issue of considerable import for consumers.52 We find the
simplification to be highly effective. It uses the second person to refer to the

reader. It starts the paragraph with a thesis statement (as in TRIAC and other
writing conventions)53 and offers a direct summary of the effect of the clause.
While generally true to the original, there is yet a subtle issue here. In the
original, changes to the contract are only effective if communicated. In the
simplified version, it is implied that changes are done unilaterally, and some users
may infer that communicating those changes is more of a courtesy than a
prerequisite. If a firm makes uncommunicated changes to its agreement, the
simplified version may mislead the consumer into thinking that the changes are
effective. Still, the difference is not large, and the actual meaning of “we will let
you know about these updates” (as per the simplified version) may be somewhat
ambiguous.
Either way, the rest of the paragraph is well-executed. The quantitative
analysis depicted in Figure 6 shows a reduction of nearly 7.5 grade levels on the
Flesch-Kincaid measure and 8 grade reduction on the average of scores of the
various readability measures. In either case, the text is evaluated as readable by
an eighth-grader. Furthermore, the simplified version reduced 26% of the text,
cutting the number of words by 33 (out of 127).54 The number of sentences
doubled from three to six due to splitting long sentences into shorter ones.
Consistently, the average word length, although not depicted (in this and the
following figures), falls from 5.17 characters to 4.45.

14.1 The parties acknowledge that any statutory or common law claims related
to intellectual property may require forms of equitable relief that are best
administered by courts; accordingly, the parties agree that except for statutory or
common law claims related to intellectual property and disputes that qualify for
small claims court, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in
contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be
resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association
(“AAA”) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the
Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. Judgment on the
award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any federal or state court of
competent jurisdiction located in the County of New York in the State of New
York. For more information about arbitration, the AAA and the arbitration
process, please consult the American Arbitration Association web site at adr.org.
You agree that by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the
right to trial by jury, except as otherwise stated above. Any arbitration under this
Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class
actions are not permitted and, by entering into this Agreement, you are giving
up the ability to participate in a class action. All issues are for the arbitrator to
decide, except that issues relating to the scope, application, and enforceability of

the arbitration provision are for the court to decide. As stated in Section 15
below, New York law applies to any arbitration under this section, but the parties
acknowledge that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
enforcement of this provision. This agreement to arbitrate shall survive
termination of this Agreement. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you
from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and, if
the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.
14.2 Unless you and we agree otherwise, the arbitration will take place either in
the subscriber’s county of principal residence or the County of New York in the
State of New York. For claims of $14,000 or less, you can choose whether you
would like arbitration carried out based only on documents submitted to the
arbitrator, or by a hearing in person, or by phone.
14.3 The arbitrator may award money or equitable relief in favor of only the
individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
warranted by that party’s individual claim. To reduce the time and expense of
the arbitration, the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or
her award unless requested to do so by both parties. Unless both you and we
agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s
claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class
proceeding.

14.1 We agree that some issues, like those tied to ideas, may need to be sorted
out by courts. Except for these, and for small disputes that fit into small claims

process called arbitration. This will be managed by the American Arbitration
Association (“AAA”). You can find more about this at adr.org. Decisions from
arbitration can be used in any federal or state court in New York County, State
of New York. By agreeing to this, both you and we give up the right to a jury
trial, except for the cases we just noted. The arbitrator will deal with issues one
by one; group arbitrations and group actions aren’t allowed. We agree that this
arbitration process, based on New York law, will still apply even after this
Agreement ends.
14.2 Unless we both say otherwise, the arbitration will happen either where you
live or in New York County, State of New York. For claims of $14,000 or less,
you get to pick how the arbitration will be done: only by looking at submitted
documents, through a meeting in person, or by phone.
14.3 The arbitrator can award money or make fair changes in favor of only the
person asking for it and only to the level needed to provide help based on their
claim. The arbitrator won’t provide a reason for the decision unless both parties
ask. The arbitrator won’t deal with more than one person’s claims at a time unless
both you and we agree otherwise.

Evaluation
This clause provides for mandatory arbitration and makes specific procedural
requirements on a highly sensitive issue that impacts access to justice, corporate
power, and the development of the law.56 While the simplification is generally
good, we note a few problems. First, perhaps by virtue of the prompt’s insistence
on a change of terms, it replaced the heading ‘Agreement to Arbitrate’ with
‘Solving Disputes.’ While the latter communicates better, it does not make the
term arbitration sufficiently salient.
Relatedly, some choices of words may implicate different legal consequences.
The model translated intellectual property to “ideas.” This change is quite
wrong: not all ideas are subject to IP, and this may give a sense that more disputes
belong in courts than the original agreement allows. Yet again, the problem here
may stem from our prompt, which insisted on using simpler terms. A similar
issue afflicts the choice of “group actions” instead of “class actions” and the
language suggesting that arbitration awards can be “used” rather than “entered.”
In terms of quality, a worrisome omission is that the original clarifies that the
customer may still bring complaints to state or federal agencies. The simplified
version does not mention that. This omission can deprive the customer of
important rights.
A final issue is that the model translated equitable relief to “fair changes.”
These two ideas differ, and the simplified version could mislead. Yet, the
dilemma of simplification of this term is quite pressing, and the average
consumer may find both terms ambiguous. It is hard to effectively translate
equitable relief—which may consist of in-kind remedies, injunctive remedies,
apologies, and other measures—to a simple term. At the same time, keeping the
original term would sacrifice the ability of laypeople to parse it. All in all, this
simplification is disputable but not irrational.
On the quantitative measures, we see a dramatic reduction in grade level
evaluated for the reading of the agreement. Again, the simplification transformed
an agreement readable by PhDs into one readable by eighth-graders. The word

off Airbnb, and even health info related to infectious diseases.
Evaluation
This provision delineates the categories of personal data that Airbnb collects
from third-party sources, which is another important practice for consumers to
understand. The simplification has successfully distilled the original provision’s
complex legal language into more accessible terms without distorting the overall
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4491043

ARBEL & BECHER HOW SMART ARE SMART READERS? 25/41
meaning. The use of “other sources” instead of third-party services is quite
helpful, and the use of “info” instead of information may be grammatically
inaccurate yet useful (or at least understandable).
However, certain points could be clearer and more comprehensive. For
instance, the simplified version omits the example that some of the information
shared may contain the user’s friends list. This omission is not misleading per se,
but we suspect that consumers may not otherwise expect Airbnb to share this
information with third-parties.
As for background checks, the simplification converts “with your consent
where required” to a proposition that implies that consent will always be sought.
This modification is misleading because sharing will sometimes occur without
consent. An arguably more minor omission regards information sharing with the
insurer. The simplified version does not mention that the privacy policy limits
information sharing; i.e., it gives a sense that information sharing is unlimited.
The quantitative measure shows another substantial improvement, reducing
the readability level from college level to sixth or seventh grade. Furthermore, the
word count has declined by 50%: from 370 words to 185. This drop included a
minimal decrease in the number of sentences (from 16 to 15) and moderate
reduction in the average word length (from 5.04 to 4.33).

This provision governs the cancellation of a Netflix subscription, yet another
tricky issue in consumer contracts.59 The simplification seems to maintain the
overall integrity of the original paragraph while making it more accessible to the

potentially mislead consumers.

the firm can make exceptions to the extent permitted by applicable law. This text
suggests that in some jurisdictions, Netflix may indeed be required to issue
refunds. In contrast, the simplified text asserts that “under current law, we can’t
refund payments.” This language indicates that Netflix is legally prohibited from
providing refunds. This erroneous interpretation potentially miscommunicates
Netflix’s refund policy to consumers, particularly those residing in regions where
laws may, in fact, mandate refunds. This difference is a major issue that can
mislead consumers and undermine their rights.
The quantitative measure shows another significant improvement, setting the
readability level at between the sixth and seventh grade (instead of the high
school level required for reading the original). At the same time, the word count
has only declined by 16% (from 163 to 137). This included a small increase in

This provision governs content contribution to the platform, most notably in
the form of reviews. This provision raises an important issue since consumers
often rely on online reviews and use them in their decision-making. Hence,
ensuring reliable and robust online information flows is crucial in disciplining
sellers and maintaining efficient markets.61
Overall, we find the simplification above to be effective. However, some
issues require attention. First, the simplified version leaves out a few important
restrictions. It fails to mention the prohibition on email spoofing and political
campaigning explicitly mentioned in the original, thereby providing less
comprehensive guidance to users. At the same time, the original possibly
contained too many illustrations, so the balance is delicate.
Second, the contract contains an important clause about the warranties
provided by users when they post content, which is especially weighty in its
implications. Users have to guarantee the accuracy of their reviews and ensure
that these reviews will not harm others. This requirement could be burdensome
to users and is quite unexpected, given that truthful reviews may well harm
unscrupulous, negligent, or underperforming sellers. The simplification
communicates most of it, but perhaps a more formal tone might be beneficial in
highlighting the gravity of these obligations. This difference potentially points to
a deeper problem at the heart of the simplification project: whereas simplification
often entails a more casual or flippant tone, formality is sometimes a good signal
of the gravity of obligations.62
By readability metrics, this was the most complex original text so far. The
reduction from 19-20 years of education to a level readable by an eighth grader
is, therefore, quite impressive. Also, the length fell by 26% (from 304 words to
226). This dip was nonetheless accompanied by an increase in the number of
sentences (from 8 to 12), which, as noted, often results from text simplification

fulfillment center. At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a
return. In this situation, Amazon does not take title to the refunded item. For
more information about our returns and refunds, please see our Returns Center.

Evaluation
This clause assigns the risk of delivery loss to the customer. Consumers may
not expect such a clause, as they have little control over Amazon’s shipping
methods. Indeed, some jurisdictions regard contract terms that relieve the
supplier of responsibility, which they would have to bear under law or by virtue
of the contract (if not for that term), as presumably unfair.64
The simplification preserves the overall meaning, but it could do better in
highlighting key customer responsibilities and exceptions. It effectively
communicates that the items belong to the buyer upon delivery to the shipper.
However, it does not communicate clearly enough that the customer bears the
risk if something goes wrong with the delivery.
The same criticism, but to a lesser extent, applies to returns. The proposed
simplification, “If you return something, it’s not ours until it gets to our
fulfillment center,” does not adequately communicate the contractual risk
allocation, such as what happens if items are lost in the return process. On the
positive side, we note the effectiveness of using “you still own” relative to “take
title.”
Figure 11 depicts the most modest improvement in readability so far.
Readability improved by just a single grade level, but that is likely because the
original is both short and relatively simple. Still, we believe greater improvements
could take place with additional prompting. Likewise, the change in length was
also relatively less substantial, with a 23% reduction (from 95 words to 73).
There was no change in the number of sentences and a marginal change to the
word length, falling from 4.64 to 4.45.

This provision governs Yahoo’s information sharing, an important aspect of
today’s markets and economies.66 The specific challenge here is that the original
has inconsistent logic. For example, it says that personally identifiable
information about customers will not be shared without consent unless it is with
advertisers with whom personally identifiable information can be shared even
without consent.
Overall, the clause attempts to set rules that allow Yahoo to share all
information in various ways and personally identifiable information in limited
ways. We find that the simplification captures this intended logic, although even
the best simplification may not overcome the difficulty of parsing what it means
for Yahoo to allow for cookie matching with partners without letting them access
their cookies. This example provides a more general, important (yet
straightforward) insight: AI simplification has limited value if the original legal
documents are not properly drafted. Slightly restated, firms might circumvent
smart readers and undermine their potential to assist consumers by adopting
specific drafting strategies.67
That aside, the simplification is overall helpful. The “you say Okay” is a rather
nice touch on “Your consent,” although given the quality of consent required (a
checkbox), it may overstate the necessary level of consent. It also omits the
confusing cookie-matching policy noted above.
More generally, the reduction in text complexity was quite dramatic. The
average readability score fell from post-high school level to a level of between
seven and eight grade. The length fell by 26% (from 355 words to 264), with a
small change to the number of sentences (from 21 to 19). Average word length
fell from 5.45 to 4.53 characters per word.

Based on the law, you agree that the only way to fix any issue or unhappiness

remove or stop using such apps from other parties.
Spotify, its staff, shareholders, workers, agents, leaders, child companies, linked

amounts you paid Spotify in the twelve months before the first claim; or (b)
$30.00. Any liability we do have for losses you go through is strictly limited to
losses that could have been reasonably seen coming.
Just to be clear, these terms do not limit Spotify’s liability for fraud, wrong
representation, death or personal injury to the extent that the law would stop
such a limit and for any other liability that, by the law, may not be limited or
taken away.
Evaluation
Liability limitation is a recurring and important theme in consumer contracts,
and many jurisdictions treat broad liability limitation clauses with suspicion.69
Unsurprisingly, Spotify’s clause considerably limits its liability. Nonetheless, its
wording is inconsistent and confusing. The clause states that the only remedy
available to the user is the uninstallation of the app, then moves to limit monetary
69 See, e.g., Council Directive 93/13/EEC, of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April

refers to “inappropriately excluding or limiting the legal rights of the consumer vis-à-vis the seller or
supplier or another party in the event of total or partial non-performance or inadequate performance by the
seller or supplier of any of the contractual obligations…”).

remedies to a maximum of $30, and then states that Spotify is liable for anything
it cannot disclaim by law.
The summary does an overall good job. It delivers the message of the
disclaimer in simple language and references the customer to dispute issues with
third parties directly. The emphasis that the liability of a third party is limited
“as far as Spotify is concerned” is useful in another aspect: It communicates a
certain indifference to such harm, and some consumers may find this warning
useful.
However, there are a few noteworthy issues with the simplification. Perhaps
guided again by our prompt, the simplification replaces special terms of art.
Thus, it changes “incidental damages” to “extra damages,” “consequential
damages” to “follow-on damages,” and “foreseeable damages” to “could have
seen coming.” Whereas the simplified version might be better in terms of
communication, it unduly alters the legal meaning of the clause.
Concerning quantitative metrics, this simplification was the least successful.
While it improved readability by seven to eight grade levels, it retained the
original structure of the paragraph-long sentence. Readability tests are not well-
calibrated to deal with such cases, and the absurd result (28.5 years of schooling
exceeds that of almost every lawyer), should be interpreted qualitatively.
Furthermore, the simplification made the document marginally longer (from
307 words to 309), suggesting that, at times, text simplification sometimes
necessitates more exposition. While there was a slight increase in the number of
sentences (from 5 to 6), we observed a reduction in average word length, falling
from 5.17 character per word to 4.45.

VI. SIMPLIFICATION OF SPECIFIC CLAUSES: DISCUSSION
Our analysis emphasizes the role of two aspects of the simplification process:
(a) enhanced accessibility (shorter length, reduced complexity, and increased
readability) and (b) quality of simplification. Regarding the former, we note that
the simplified clauses did well on all the quantitative metrics. In each case, the
improvement in readability metrics was significant; on average, reducing the
reader’s required education level by half.
While we do not necessarily endorse a literal interpretation of the specific
grade level assignment, we do recognize the difference as large and meaningful.
At the same time, as the Spotify example illustrates, simplified texts might still
be inaccessible by standard metrics. The same applies to length and complexity:
While the simplified versions presented a substantial improvement on these
dimensions, there is no guarantee that consumers are willing to read even these
shorter and less complicated texts.
Importantly, the improvement in readability was associated with shorter
clauses. This facet is noteworthy, as simplification often requires more
exposition. At the same time, the impact on the number of sentences varied, and
the effect on word length was relatively mild. However, setting objective metrics
aside, we observed an overall significant improvement. The simplified texts were
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4491043

<<PAGE_BREAK>>

ARBEL & BECHER HOW SMART ARE SMART READERS? 39/41
more accessible and used simple and direct language, making them easier to read
and understand.
In terms of accuracy, our report is more mixed. Simplifications of specific
clauses were generally accurate and beneficial, especially considering we
intentionally chose problematic clauses. Nevertheless, we noticed a range of
issues. Some were relatively minor, such as not using a formal tone or failing to
include an example that some consumers would find useful. Other issues were
more substantial, such as suggesting that consent will be actively sought from the
user when it would not, or when omitting the customer’s right to complain to
state and federal agencies.
An additional significant issue we observed is the incorrect usage of legal
terminology. Using “follow-on damages” instead of “consequential damages”
entailed more than just confusing the informed consumer. These two concepts
of damages are distinct, having very different legal implications. Admittedly, this
error may be our own making: the prompt insisted that complex words should
be simplified. A less stringent approach would not invite such losses in meaning,
although it could compromise the simplification’s effectiveness. Yet, to know
whether a given term is a term-of-art or a colloquial term requires some domain
expertise, and this may point to a limitation of at least current generation general
models.
This last point introduces a potentially thorny issue. We generally assume
that the canonical contract is the one held by the seller, rather than the one
interpreted by the smart reader. However, we wonder if some sellers will persuade
the court to adopt the smart reader’s version when it serves them by arguing that
this is the version the customer presumably used. If courts follow this path,
changes to terms-of-art can be harmful to the buyer.
Finally, our analysis did not touch on bias, toxicity, and hallucinations—
several issues that afflict current generation models.70 These issues were fairly
muted in our analysis, but we do expect them to become relevant as consumers
use smart readers more frequently. We thus acknowledge that our inspection is
limited in ways that future research may seek to tackle.

VII. SUMMARY
Our study suggests that smart readers can substantially shorten legal texts,
reduce their complexity, and improve their readability. Our assessment also
indicates that smart readers typically identify important information and include
this information in their summaries. Overall, it was encouraging and impressive
to find that the simplifications did not substantially undermine the quality of the
text and the scope of information that consumers receive.71 Thus, if consumers
choose to use smart readers, this decision could have significant impact on the
viability of HIDE strategies and other market outcomes.
The in-depth evaluation of the simplification of specific clauses reinforced
our conclusion that while the overall quality of simplification is very high, it is
not perfect. However, perfection is not the benchmark. Considerable literature
finds that in many domains, consumers rarely read dense legal texts. In such
cases, consumers proceed with a vague understanding of the underlying
transaction. Provided that smart readers simplify contracts and policies and make
them readable, then as long as they are not materially misleading, they can
enhance consumers’ decision-making. Specifically, smart readers could
potentially facilitate informed decisions, enhance efficiency, and thus encourage
competition over terms and pressure sellers to draft better contracts.
Furthermore, many consumers may wish to examine legal texts ex post, once or
a dispute arises or when encountering an issue with the transaction they entered.
Smart readers can serve well these consumers, who are likely to have more
tailored queries and specific aspects to decipher.
Ultimately, simplification tools do not replace lawyers and do not render the
original drafting entirely irrelevant to the end consumer. Still, they offer a
marked improvement over current consumers’ realistic alternatives, such as not
reading the text and misperceiving legal aspects. Furthermore, our analysis
suggests that smart readers may not only serve individual consumers, but also
71 It is worth noting that while our quality assessment was labor-intensive and had subjective aspects,
future developments may advance automated tools to evaluate the quality of legal summaries at scale. See,
e.g., Bianca Steffes, Piotr Rataj, Luise Burger, & Lukas Roth, On Evaluating Legal Summaries With
ROUGE, in PROC. NINETEENTH INT’L CONF. A.I. & L. 475 (2023) (finding that current tools are
insufficient for quality evaluation and suggesting to increase the reliability of ROUGE by pre-selecting
sentences); see also Huyen Nguyen & Junhua Ding, Keyword-Based Augmentation Method to Enhance
Abstractive Summarization for Legal Documents, in PROC. NINETEENTH INT’L CONF. A.I. & L. 437 (2023)
(finding that keywords-based augmentation is effective in improving quality and enhancing summarization
models).

energize intermediaries and consumer organizations who can scale up the use of
such tools.
Notably, we used non-specialized models with little special domain training
to deliver these results, which implies that our findings represent a lower bound,
rather than an upper limit. It seems more realistic than ever that smart readers
will soon have the ability to automatically detect problematic terms, warn
consumers about them, evaluate contracts on a scale, compare contracts, and
benchmark them.72 Consumers can consult with a smart reader in a Q&A mode,
asking questions like “What happens if I don’t pay the balance in full?” or “Can
I switch providers when I want to?”. Such advances can transform consumer
contracting.
Against this revolutionary potential, it is crucial to keep the concerns around
accuracy, capture, and bias in mind. Today’s models make errors, and these
errors may not be neutral.73 It is possible that as smart readers grow in influence,
companies will wish to influence their output or find ways to mislead them or
circumvent their potential. It is, therefore, necessary to consider these concerns
when evaluating the technology and its trajectory. In this context, massive open-
source models may limit the potential for invisible model corruption.
Our assessment of current generation models concludes that smart readers
have arrived. They are not (yet) a full replacement for careful review by a lawyer.
However, for the large mass of contracts and privacy policies that today go
unread, they serve as a cheap, effective, and scalable alternative. If their potential
materializes, a law and policy paradigm shift would be appropriate, if not
inevitable.
72 Combining language models with technologies that can automate the detection of unfair terms in
consumer contracts is a promising path to consider. For a study that experimentally examines the use of
machine learning platforms to perform such detection, see Marco Lippi, Przemyslaw Palka, Giuseppe
Contissa, Francesca Lagioia, Hans-Wolfgang Micklitz, Yannis Panagis, Giovanni Sartor, & Paolo Torroni,

REPUTATION FAILURE: THE LIMITS OF MARKET
DISCIPLINE IN CONSUMER MARKETS
Yonathan A. Arbel*
Many believe that consumer-sourced reputational
information about products should increasingly replace top-
down regulation. Instead of protecting consumers through
coercive laws, reputational information gleaned from the
wisdom of the crowd would guide consumer decision-making.
There is now a growing pressure to deregulate in diverse
fields such as contracts, products liability, consumer
protection, and occupational licensing.
This Article presents a common failure mode of systems
of reputation: “Reputation Failure.” By spotlighting the
public-good nature of reviews, rankings, and even gossip, this
Article shows the mismatch between the private incentives
consumers have to create reputational information and its
social value. As a result of this divergence, reputational
information is beset by participation, selection, and social
desirability biases that systematically distort it. This Article
argues that these distortions are inherent to most systems of
reputation and that they make reputation far less reliable
than traditionally understood.
The limits of reputation highlight the centrality of the
law to the future of the marketplace. Proper legal institutions
can deal not only with the symptoms of reputation failure—
consumer mistakes—but improve the flow and quality of
reputational information, thus correcting reputation failures
before they arise. This Article offers a general framework and

great caution. The source of these distortions and the role of the law
in addressing them are the key themes developed here.
Some of the most important debates in contract law involve a
basic dilemma: to what extent can markets be trusted to regulate
themselves?1 One reason why regulation may be needed is
asymmetric information—if sellers know more, they can exploit
buyers and promise high but deliver low. A mitigating factor, which
counsels against less regulation, is reputation. Reputation
information, once the province of small-knit communities, allows
parties to develop trust based on self-interest.2 If the seller cheats,
her reputation will suffer, costing her opportunities to deal with other
buyers. In the last two decades, reputational information has
permeated almost all aspects of consumer markets, online and offline.
Through the use of rankings, reviews, and stars, reputation facilitates
transactions between complete strangers.
The explosion of reputational information has instilled a sense of
optimism among many that the end of asymmetric information is
nigh.3 Why regulate markets, the argument goes, if consumers can
easily know in advance which seller is honest, which product is best,
and which service provider is most reliable? The increased trust in

standing. For example, Milton Friedman argued that “consumers do not have to
be hemmed in by rules and regulation . . . because they are protected by the
market itself.” Milton Friedman’s Free to Choose: Who Protects the Consumers?

mouth, online reviews, and product ranking, consumers create a body
of reputational information covering innumerable products and
services—from restaurants and keychains to doctors and car
mechanics.8 This information is then used by future consumers to
guide their own decision-making, but the original creators of this
information are rarely, if ever, compensated for their efforts.9 That
is, while the costs of creating reputational information are private,
the benefits are public. Observing the divergence of private and
public costs presents a deep puzzle for all systems of reputation: Who
chooses to participate in the creation and dissemination of
reputational information, why, and to what effect?
In spotlighting this puzzle and exploring its consequences, this
Article identifies a common failure mode of reputational information,
called “reputation failure.” Prospective consumers use reputational
information to learn about the experiences of a representative sample
of similarly situated consumers. This kind of “poll” could inform the
consumer about the expected quality of service, the frequency of
errors, and the honesty of the seller. However, this poll is subject to
three confounding factors: sluggishness, regression to the extreme, and
an integrity bias. Reputational information is sluggish, i.e., slow to
develop, because sharing consumers are not sufficiently incented to
share their experiences. The motivations to share are not only weak,
but they are also asymmetric; psychologically, individuals are more
inclined to share information when they had a very positive or
negative experience. Thus, reputational information tends to “regress
to the extremes,” or develop over time in a way that overly emphasizes
extreme experiences at the expense of middling ones. And even those
experiences that are shared are not always authentic: social and
financial motivations to share lead some individuals to misstate their
experiences in ways that put themselves in a better light or otherwise
favor them. This leads to an integrity bias.
In the presence of reputation failure, dishonest sellers can thrive,
not just in the short term but also over longer spans of time.
Reputation failure thus suggests the limits of market discipline
through reputational information.10

1244 WAKE FOREST LAW REVIEW [Vol. 54
These concerns with reputation failure are consistent with some
important trends in the empirical data.11 Amazon is a case in point;
despite the cornucopia of products listed there, reviews follow an
unusual distribution.12 One might expect that among so many
products, some reviews would be exciting and others disappointing,
but that the majority would be middling. Evidence from millions of
products contradicts this expectation; reviews concentrate in the
extremes and are scarce in the middle.13 Additional evidence
suggests that the properties of the products themselves do not drive
this unusual distribution. For example, there is little agreement—
quite often, disagreement—between the rating of the same products
by professionals and consumers.14 There is also little agreement
among consumers on different platforms regarding the same
products.15 And when consumers are asked to rate products in lab
settings, their reviews show a remarkably different distribution.16
Despite reputation failures, consumers reportedly rely on
reputational information. In a recent survey, 82 percent of American
adults said they sometimes or always read reviews before making
new purchases, and more than two-thirds of those who routinely use
reviews described them as “generally accurate.”17 Similarly, a survey
of online users found that, on average, users rated the credibility of
the last review they read as a 4.2 out of five, or roughly 84 percent,
on average.18
Not all reputation failures are severe but ignoring the risk of
failure is a serious omission. In some cases, sophisticated consumers
might be able to mitigate part of the distortionary effect of reputation
failure by interpreting reputational information using a combination
of freedom of contract have generally rejected intervention by relying on
reputational constraints.”).

of heuristics, statistical analysis, multisource analysis, and
experience.19 However, it is important to recognize that the power of
these methods is limited; there is only so much signal that can be
extracted from a biased and noisy sample.20 To illustrate this claim,
I employ a method known as a Monte-Carlo simulation, which
illustrates the limits of such heuristics.21
Like other forms of market failure, the existence of reputation
failure has various legal implications. Most directly, reputation
failures call for greater scrutiny of consumer transactions and stricter
regulation of product safety and quality. Such regulation can come in
the form of mandatory warranties, broader disclosure obligations,
good-faith requirements, product liability duties, etc.22
Legal interventions, however, need not be limited to the
consequences of reputation failure. The law can also improve the
quality of reputation itself, thus avoiding the failure of reputation in
the first place. To this end, I propose here a new framework of
synthesizing legal institutions and markets, called Reputation-by-
Regulation. Policymakers can significantly improve consumer
welfare while preserving consumer autonomy by focusing on
designing rules that improve and increase the flow of reliable
reputational information to the market. Building channels through
which reputational information can effectively flow to the market can
solve reputation failure and allow consumers to choose freely and
effectively for themselves. To guide future policymaking, this Article
illustrates Reputation-by-Regulation through five concrete types of
effective legal interventions.
The analysis in this Article should also inform economic analysis
more generally. It is very common, even in leading economic models,
to assume that reputation is an inherent feature of the market.23
Sellers sell, buyers buy, and reliable reputational information
miraculously emerges.24 These studies could benefit from explicit

recognition of the “microfoundations” of reputation—the incentives
that lead individuals to share their experiences with others, and their
consequences for the reliability of reputational information.25
This Article unfolds in five parts. Part II explores the role of
reputation in our thinking about the proper scope of intervention in
consumer markets. It highlights how central is the idea that
reputation is reliable. Part III develops the “microfoundations” of
reputation. It surveys the motivations to produce reputational
information and explains how these lead to systemic bias. Finally,
Part IV explores the legal-market interface and the use of the law to
improve reputational information flows.
II. LAW VS. MARKETS AND ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION
This Part surveys debates on regulation, deregulation, and the
role of reputation. It shows how critical reputation is to these debates
and yet how very little attention is given to the reliability of
reputational information. As this Article will show, imperfections
and failures in reputational information undermine the validity and
persuasiveness of many market self-ordering arguments.
A. Law vs. Markets
Most commercial transactions involve asymmetric information
between sellers and buyers. Buying a refrigerator or a car, hiring a
contractor, and seeking a financial advisor are all quotidian
transactions that involve what economists call “experience” goods—
i.e., goods where the consumer can only observe quality after
consumption or usage.26 The concern with such transactions is that
the recent edition of the Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, there are early signs
of recognition of these problems: “[T]he literature on this area [of reputation in
large groups] is in its infancy; very little can be said with much certainty now.”

25. See, e.g., Roy Shapira, Reputation Through Litigation: How the Legal
System Shapes Behavior by Producing Information, 91 WASH. L. REV. 1193, 1203
(2016) (describing the perception of reputation in the scholarship as the product
of a simple process). This reductive view uncritically assumes, with only a few
exceptions, that reputation information is reliable. For prominent examples in
economics, see, e.g., Heski Bar-Isaac & Steven Tadelis, Seller Reputation, 4

Board & Meyer-Ter-Vehn, supra note 23, at 2386–87. A leading paper in
evolutionary psychology argues that reputation is an evolutionary solution to the
tragedy of the commons with respect to public goods, not acknowledging that the
creation of reputation itself suffers from the same problem. See Manfred
Milinsky et al., Reputation Helps Solve the ‘Tragedy of the Commons’, 415 NATURE

they invite opportunistic behavior, as sellers might take advantage of
the information asymmetry by promising high but delivering low.27
This possibility, left unchecked, would lead to misallocation of
resources, abuse of buyers, and increased buyer trepidation, stalling
economic activity overall.28
The conventional response to such problems is direct regulation.
To give but a few examples, the law sets ex ante minimum quality
regulations;29 mandates price controls;30 imposes good-faith duties;31
compels mandatory disclosure;32 creates implied warranties of
merchantability and fitness;33 requires licensing, training, and
testing;34 enforces truth-in-advertising requirements;35 and imposes
tort and criminal liability for violations of any of these standards.36
All of these measures are meant to curb abuse of asymmetric
information and to facilitate trust in the market. With regulation,
241 (Micheal J. Houston ed., 1988). A subtle issue is that while individual
preferences are idiosyncratic, they are still predictive. A consumer contemplating
the purchase of a microwave may be different in any number of ways from past
consumers, yet, learning that other consumers disliked the microwave would still
inform the consumer’s private decision.

consumers can trust—to an extent—that a car seat, for example, will
be sufficiently safe even if the producer is unknown or that an
unfamiliar merchant will not engage in unfair business practices.

necessarily limit freedom of contract, and instead argue that law is
“only one of many social institutions and practices amid which
markets function.”37 One such institution, arguably the most central
one, is reputation.38 Part of Adam Smith’s genius was the insight that
reputation facilitates trust in markets, even if actors are self-
interested; as Smith explained, the baker will soon realize that selling
low-quality bread will diminish his reputation and thus future profits,
making dishonesty an unprofitable business strategy.39 Drawing on
this insight, influential scholars such as Milton Friedman, Richard
Posner, and Richard Epstein have called to deregulate markets and
rely instead on internal market discipline.40
These debates are longstanding and tend to track traditional
political stances on the government, top-down regulation, and the free
market.41 Recently, however, a sea change has swept many
progressives and left-leaning thinkers towards the deregulatory
camp.42 The rise of the sharing economy and information technology
has inspired widespread belief in the impending death of asymmetric
information.43 In the past, private ordering through reputation was
understood to be the domain of small-knit communities, such as
Orthodox Jewish diamond traders or cattle ranchers in small
counties, as these small communities could effectively exchange

and often misguided government intervention.48 Given this new
zeitgeist, there is little in the way of effective opposition to the recent
policy trends that have dramatically scaled down consumer
protection.49
To give a sense of where the contemporary battle lines are
drawn, consider the influential debate between Professors Richard
Epstein and Oren Bar-Gill (who also serves as a reporter for the new
Restatement of Consumer Contracts).50 Both scholars debate the old
question of asking how severely contract law should limit the freedom
of contract in the name of other interests.51 Epstein concedes the
existence and importance of cognitive constraints on consumer
decision-making, which he agrees can lead to “serious mistakes.”52
Still, in his view, “second-order rationality” in the form of reputation,
among other sources, can overcome these shortcomings.53
Remarkably, Epstein sees reputation as a valid response to the new
problems posed to the traditional model by behavioral economics.54
In contrast, Bar-Gill argues that because goods are sometimes
unique, or consumers use them in unique ways, there is too little
information that is transferable among consumers.55 Under such
conditions, Bar-Gill contends, there is still a need for regulatory
interventions in private contracts, such as safety standards or
immutable warranties.56
The most surprising feature of this debate is not the
disagreement but the broad agreement that underlies it. For
standardized goods (or standard uses), reputation, in addition to

other background pressures, can be sufficiently potent to curb
opportunistic behavior. Hence, contract and consumer law need not
worry about intervening in areas where product reputation is
abundant.57 Similar attitudes were expressed by other leading
figures in the field and in the context of torts, occupational licensing,
and even drug regulation.58 As shall become clear, the existence of
reputation failures undermines this view.
B. The Supposed Reliability of Reputation in Legal Thought
These debates highlight the centrality of the belief that
reputation is an effective, dependable, credible, and reliable
regulator.59 Advocates argue that the loss of reputation is immediate,
independent of lengthy and uncertain trials, and stems from the
interactions of the parties themselves.60 Additionally, reputation
allows parties to tap into assets that the legal system cannot reach.61
For these reasons, advocates believe that what the law does slowly
and inaccurately, reputation can do quickly and precisely.62

Jeffrey J. Rachlinski, Standard-Form Contracting in the Electronic Age, 77

1252 WAKE FOREST LAW REVIEW [Vol. 54
As central as reputation is to these debates, it is perplexing to see
how little attention is given to reputation’s nature.63 Instead, the
literature mostly relies on a simplistic “emergentist” view of
reputation that ignores all questions of how reputation comes to be.64
The reputation of goods and services is described as simply emerging
from complex market interactions.65 A seller sells a widget and once
enough consumers purchase and use it, the widget “automatically”
gains a reputation for quality.66 Somehow, reputation emerges. From
where? How? By whom? These issues are hardly ever addressed.
Instead, reputation is taken to be, as Shapira pointedly notes, “[a]
frictionless, uncomplicated process in which individuals somehow get
access to information.”67
It is hard to overstate just how common it is for people to perceive
that reputation is reliable and how much this perception influences
policy. Take, for example, economic models of market transactions;
there, it is common to assume that “[t]he moment that a person
cheats, it becomes common knowledge that the person lacks integrity,
and hence there is no cooperation for the rest of the game.”68 In the
foundational Klein-Leffler model of reputation, consumers are
explicitly assumed to “costlessly communicate [quality information]
among one another.”69 Such spontaneous reputational information is
then thought to propagate “throughout the community without

Reputation and the Constitution, 74 CALIF. L. REV. 691, 692 (1986) (describing
reputation as a “mysterious thing”).
64. A view is emergentist if it identifies a phenomenon only at the complex
level. For example, the quality of “saltiness” does not describe the taste of
chlorine or sodium, yet their combination creates a salty ionic compound; a grain
of sand has no “pileness” to it, but once enough grains are collected, a pile
emerges; or, more contentiously, no neuron has self-awareness, yet their
collection seems to cause conscience. This omission is hardly unique to law; for a
recent example in other fields, see Wenqi Shen et al., Competing for Attention:

institutional help.”70 In legal scholarship, this conception arises most
clearly in defamation law jurisprudence where reputation is thought
of as a right—natural, static, or inherent, like property or dignity—
that comes into being by immaculate conception and must be
“protected” against those who seek to besmirch it.71
Some scholars have started to recognize cracks in the traditional
paradigm.72 As they note, reputational information may be costly to
obtain, noisy,73 distorted by the incentives of intermediaries,74 or
ineffectual (if, for example, a sellers’ presence in the market is short-
lived).75 Economists Paul Milgrom and John Roberts focus on the
difficulty of creating reputation when opportunistic behavior is hard
to detect.76 Similarly, Professor Alan Schwartz notes the potential
costs of reputation, explaining that “the innocent party [to a failed
transaction] will incur costs in informing others that it was not at
fault, and third parties will incur costs learning about which of the
contract parties is unreliable.”77 Finally, Professor Bar-Gill
emphasizes the possibility that in some markets there will be an
insufficient volume of reputational information.78 Still, even
admitting reputation’s potential noise does not amount to a claim that
recognizes the inherent systematic distortion of reputational
information.79 Rather, the noise is thought to disappear, as new
information accumulates and “increases the diagnosticity” and
persuasiveness of reputation.80 Moreover, these are exceptions. The
dominant view in the policy and scholarship is still very much
emergentist, expressing great trust in the reliability of reputation.
The emergentist view is problematic for several reasons, not the
least of which is its lack of any theoretical underpinnings that explain
when—and when not—reputation will come to be. Why is

information about some products abundant whereas information for
other products is sparse? Another problem is that many jurists have
come to think of reputation as a right that belongs to individuals,81
rather than the byproducts of dynamic social processes.82 As a result,
much of the discussion about reputation neglects its social value.83
But most disconcerting is the implication that reputation is generally
reliable—that it fairly describes the quality of the underlying good
without systematic bias. After all, if reputation simply emerges,
there is no process by which it will be “tainted.” Thus, the proposition
that reputation can be unreliable cuts at heart, nerve, and sinew of
these influential works.
III. REPUTATION FAILURE: MICROFOUNDATIONS, DISTORTIONS, AND
SOCIAL WELFARE
When my neighbor complained that his newly purchased lawn
mower was shoddy, he created reputational information.84 When user
“daniel” wrote on Amazon that a play tent has “the stability of a house
of cards,” he or she created reputational information.85 When
musician Dave Caroll uploaded his song “United Breaks Guitars” to
YouTube, he created reputational information, and powerful
information at that: United’s stock price fell ten cents, representing a
market cap loss of $180 million.86

distribution and valence of experiences of past consumers.87 As such,
reputational information is like a poll. But as the examples highlight,
this kind of information does not simply emerge; rather, it is the fruit
of deliberate action by disparate individuals who decide to take time
and effort to share reviews, opinions, gossip, and other word-of-mouth
information.
The most basic observation to make is that such peer-to-peer
reputational information is a public good.88 While everyone benefits
from having this public resource, producers of reputational
information are not directly compensated for their contributions.
Private costs and public benefits are a recipe for the well-known
free-rider problem—like national defense, clean air, and a vaccinated
society—where there is a constant concern with overconsumption and
undersupply.89
Once reputation is seen as public good, a deep puzzle is exposed:
What motivates individuals to share reputational information? Who
does so? And, critically, to what effect?90
This Part explores these “microfoundations” of reputation and
their consequences. It shows how people share experiences for
reasons that are mostly private and self-serving.91 As a result, future
consumers are often exposed to a highly unrepresentative and biased
sample of limited credibility. Inferences drawn from such samples
can be highly misleading, even for those consumers who are aware of
them and try to account for them. As data scientists would say: Bias
in, bias out.92
87. See Goldman, supra note 9, at 294; Shapira, supra note 25, at 1201.
88. See Cowen, supra note 7. Once reputational information exists, it is hard
to prevent people from using it (i.e., it is non-excludability); nor does use of this
resource diminish it (i.e., it is non-rivalry). See Larry Downes, The Economics of
Information: From Dismal Science to Strange Tales, in THE NEXT DIGITAL DECADE
273, 277–78 (Berin Szoka & Adam Marcus eds., 2010). Professional publications
solve these problems by commoditizing the information they produce, which is
subject to copyright and other protections. See, e.g., N.Y. GEN. BUS. LAW § 397
(McKinney 1961) (prohibiting the unconsented use of nonprofits’ test results by
nonprofits).
89. Today, reputational platforms reap most of the benefit of reputation
aggregation, but reputation’s direct producers receive very little reward. These
issues are sometimes conceptualized as a tragedy of the commons. See Garrett
Hardin, The Tragedy of the Commons, 162 SCI. MAG. 1243, 1243–48 (1968).
90. By and large, legal scholars have glossed over this question. One notable
exception is Robert D. Cooter, Decentralized Law for A Complex Economy: The
Structural Approach to Adjudicating the New Law Merchant, 144 U. PA. L. REV.
1643, 1669 (1996) (arguing that individuals disseminate reputational
information due to an internalized social norm).

1256 WAKE FOREST LAW REVIEW [Vol. 54
A. The Microfoundations of Reputation
1. The Costs of Gossip
Creating and sharing reputational information involves effort,
time, and, in some cases, the risk of legal liability. “Bianca S.” must
have spent the better part of her lunch break writing a 143-word
review of a cleaning service attached alongside six photos of her
home.93 One anonymous Amazon user probably spent at least a few
minutes writing a 291-word review of his experiences with Kevlar
gloves,94 and “The Amazing Lucas” in all likelihood spent a few hours
creating and editing a seven-minute review of the movie It.95 Not only
is creating reviews time consuming, it is also sometimes emotionally
difficult to say negative things about others.96 Beyond these costs, as
will be elaborated below, there is a growing tendency among some
service providers to sue consumers for negative reviews, using factual
inaccuracies and misstatements to ground their lawsuits.97 Such
lawsuits can involve months of litigation, a serious disruption, and—
in some rare cases—large judgments.98
These broadly-defined costs suggest that there must be
countervailing motivations to produce reputational information, or
else people—as distinct from sellers, advertisers, and affiliates—will
not generate reputational information. Citing the utility of
reputation to the operation and efficiency of the market, as well as
the welfare of future consumers, is insufficient as these are public
benefits.99 What needs to be determined, then, are the specific private
benefits—what the sharing individual gets from incurring these
costs.

word-of-mouth activity.100 In an influential paper, psychologist
Ernest Dichter highlighted four internal motivations: self-centered
perceptions, quality of experience, altruistic motivations, and
message involvement.101 In the presence of these factors, individuals
would be motivated to create and share reputational information.102
Over time, however, this theory encountered difficulties. Most
problematic were the empirical findings that consumers are more
likely to share reputational information when they had a favorable
experience.103 Yet other evidence showed the exact opposite:
dissatisfaction yields greater propensity to share.104 In 1998,
business professor Eugene Anderson reconciled these findings by
explaining that the underlying issue is the extremity of experience
rather than its valence.105 Further, current work in psychology
explains the creation of favorable and negative reviews as a distinct
activity motivated by different internal impetus. For example, D.S.
Sundaram et al. argued that positive word-of-mouth results from
altruism,106 product involvement, self-enhancement, and a desire to
help the company, whereas negative word-of-mouth is due to anxiety
reduction, vengeance, altruism, and advice-seeking purposes.107
Critically, these internal drivers are related to the quality of the
experience. The standard Expectation Disconfirmation Theory holds
that the gap between expectation and reality creates a sense of
100. The propensity to help others, as well as the idea that one must
“retaliate” against wrongs and “reward” generosity, has strong roots in
evolutionary psychology and social norms. See ELINOR OSTROM, TRUST AND

disequilibrium in the consumer that manifests as feelings of spite or
gratitude that motivate action.108 A recently developed, empirically
successful variant of this theory is the tractable “brag and moan”
model. This model stipulates that independent of expectations,
extreme experiences would motivate individuals to share their
opinions with others.109 The problem is, however, that many if not
most products and services are not extreme in the experiences they
generate.110 The theory holds that these tepid experiences will tend
to be suppressed because they are “boring” and do not evoke any sense
of spite or gratitude.111 Empirical research strongly supports this
prediction.112
3. Social Pressures and Herd Behavior
Aristotle was not wrong: man is a social animal. As such, we are
in some sense “programmed” to cooperate, reciprocate, and engage in
social behavior.113 It is no coincidence that reputation-creating
activities stand at the center of so many social activities.114 In social
gatherings, individuals gossip, share experiences, and impart
opinions with other members of the social community.115 Such
activities have a clear social function. When transgressors violate
community norms, gossip and related activities allow members of the
community to learn of the violation and take concerted social action
against the transgressor, such as avoidance, disrespect, and in
extreme cases, shunning and excommunication.116 Fearing this,

community members feel a strong pressure to conform, thus
maintaining social norms.117
The standard view of social pressures fails to consider the many
ways that social forces can also undermine cooperation.118 If a seller
misbehaves in a market, it is important that buyers share this
information. But proper socialization often consists of masking one’s
true feelings, forgiving slights, and avoiding offending others even at
the cost of distorting reality (i.e., “white lies”). Forgiveness and
charity can play a negative role by leading consumers to avoid
pursuing action.119 Even reciprocity can be problematic, as
discovered inadvertently by eBay’s engineers.120 In one iteration,
buyers and sellers could rate each other after every transaction.121
This led reviewers to post (artificially) favorable reviews in the hope
that their counterparts will positively review them.122 Consumers
explained their behavior as being motivated by fear of retaliation: “[I]f
I left a bad review, I might be afraid of being retaliated against.”123 A
similar issue arises with Uber and Lyft, where both drivers and
passengers rate each other.124 In addition, individuals often mask
their opinions due to the Social Desirability Bias,125 the pressure to
strategically project socially acceptable opinions.126 A hijab-wearing
interviewer would hear more women reporting themselves as
religious than an unveiled one.127 Similarly, this bias often leads
people to misreport tax compliance, porn consumption, homosexual

activities, recycling, and charity.128 It is hard to overstate the
tendency of individuals to misstate opinions given this bias.129
Social pressures often result in individuals herding around
popular opinions.130 Herding is the convergence of opinions, a
phenomenon very familiar in public debates, whereby participants
“often shift their public statements in accordance with reputational
incentives.”131 Herding is also well documented in the context of
reviews.132 Experiments by University of Washington Professor Ann
Schlosser found that exposing subjects to past negative reviews
increases the likelihood that the subject will also voice a negative
review.133 Similarly, reviews for popular movies tend to lump around
leading opinions.134 Interestingly, some individuals exhibit an
antiherding behavior whereby they strategically express
nonconforming opinions, possibly in an attempt to lead the herd.135
While it is hard to assess the overall effect of social motivations in the
abstract, the effect seems large. As marketing professors Wendy Moe
and David Schwiedel concluded: “[A] vocal subset of the customer
base may dominate the ratings environment, consequently steering
the subsequently posted evaluations and deterring some customers
from contributing to the environments.”136

4. Material Incentives: Shilling and Cherry-Picking
Material rewards are the most direct form of incentivizing
individuals to share reputational information. The familiar version
of that is “shilling,” also known as “fake reviews” or “astroturfing,”
which involves the provision of payments in exchange for (unfounded)
positive reviews.137 Shilling is reported to be quite common, with
some estimating that as much as 30 percent of online reviews are
fake.138 In 2013, for example, Samsung was fined $340,000 because
it paid for fake reviews—both positive reviews for their own products
and negative reviews for their competitors.139 Various websites offer
full reimbursement of the purchase of certain products in exchange
for positive reviews, which are then reported by the unwitting
platforms as being made by “verified users.”140 Firms also use
negative rewards, i.e., sanctions, to deter consumers from sharing
negative reviews.141 Until the recent passing of the Consumer Review
Fairness Act, and perhaps continuing despite the law, firms would
include nondisparagement clauses in contracts with consumers.142 In
addition, firms sometimes threaten consumers with legal action for
defamation or use copyright law to argue that a review infringes on

their copyright and should be taken down.143 Shilling strategies are
highly diverse, sophisticated, and reportedly quite potent.144
A related but less understood problem is that of “cherry-picking.”
Companies often selectively choose consumers who are most likely to
disseminate either favorable or unfavorable information and reward
them.145 As is very familiar, businesses offer thinly veiled bribes to
unhappy consumers in the form of reimbursements, free meals, or
“heartfelt” apologies.146 Celebrities and other influencers are also
more likely to receive special treatment in the hope that they will
share their (unrepresentative) experiences with their many
followers.147
Both shilling and cherry-picking result from strategic behavior
on behalf of firms. Both result in and emphasize more extreme
opinions, at the extreme of middling ones.148 This is because it would
not pay to invest in promoting middling reviews.149

framework developed in the last Subpart, three systemic distortions
will be expounded here, relating to participation, selection, and
content biases. The implications for consumer action are explored in
the following Part, but the overall arc of the argument is that in the
presence of these distortions, a reputation failure emerges, which
undermines the reliability of reputational information.
1. Reputational Sluggishness
Reputational sluggishness is the consequence of feeble, yet
existing, motivations to contribute to the public good of reputation.
On the one hand, reputation creators do not benefit financially from
creating reputational information.151 It is hard to commoditize
opinions and the transaction costs of doing so are prohibitive.152 On
the other hand, there are drivers that incentivize individuals to create
reputational information even in the absence of monetary
compensation. Altruism, desire for social recognition, gratitude, and
anger all provide reasons for people to create reputational
information that benefits others.153 Sluggishness emphasizes the
concern that for many individuals, or in many circumstances, these
benefits are insufficient. As a result, participation rates in reputation
creation are going to be low, leading reputational information to be
more slowly developed than is generally recognized.154
Empirical data, while wanting, suggests the broad scope of this
issue. One study found a sharing rate of fifteen out of a thousand
consumers.155 More optimistic estimates suggest a rate of one in
ten.156 In my analysis of product review data from Amazon, I found
that among electronics products with at least one review, the median
product only had two reviews.157 Moreover, few elect to write long
151. Today, reputational platforms reap most of the benefit of reputation
aggregation, but reputation’s direct producers receive very little reward. See also
Goldman, supra note 9, at 301.
152. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies may be promising solutions to such
transactions as they offer—in theory—trivial transaction costs. In the future, it
may be possible to commoditize opinions and employ a pay-per-use model.

every negative review there are three times as many complaints to
customer service, which strongly indicates that many negative
reviews are either not generated or are deleted.159 In fact, this three
to one ratio seems like a lower bound on the scope of suppression of
opinions by users because it is reasonable that there would be many
more negative reviews than there would be active complaints. A more
speculative source of data, but interesting nonetheless, comes from
the sanitation reputation of restaurants in Los Angeles. In a series
of studies, researchers attempted to establish the effect of a law that
required restaurants to disclose their sanitation ratings.160 In a naïve
model of reputation the impact of such a law on food-borne illnesses
should be relatively small.161 If a person contracts such an illness,
then conditions are ripe for the word to travel fast: a food-borne illness
is highly salient, it is moderately easy to establish its cause, and it is
of great interest to prospective diners.162 Then, mandatory disclosure
of sanitation levels would then not be expected to have a significant
effect on food-borne illness because the information would already
exist throughout the market. Despite that, the study found that the
law had a powerful effect, with a sharp decline in hospitalizations due
to foodborne illnesses.163 The law’s effectiveness is amenable to a few
explanations, but one is that the reputation system was too congested
to work properly before the law—despite the ideal background
conditions.

2. Regression to the Extreme
So far, we saw that only some consumers would choose to produce
reputational information, but this leaves the question of who those
consumers are. If the sample of consumers who produce reputation
is randomly selected, then we would expect the outliers to experience
what statisticians call “regression to the mean,” i.e., the eventual
balancing of outliers towards the mean of the group.164 Indeed, the
regression to the mean will be impeded by sluggishness, but there is
the possibility of self-correction over time with a randomly selected
sample. Unfortunately, the selection of consumers is all but random.
Regression to the extreme is the propensity of reputational data
to emphasize, rather than eliminate, outlier experiences over time.
Internal motivations select against middling reviews because those
reviews are based on experiences that are too “boring” to generate the
requisite sense of spite or gratitude that will overcome the costs of
producing reputational information.165 Additionally, reciprocity
norms would lead consumers to overly represent positive experience,
in hopes of receiving reciprocal reviews from sellers,166 and herding
would tend to silence nonpopular reviews that might betray the
consumer’s lack of sophistication.167 If a bottle of French wine
receives paeans, an individual consumer may be embarrassed to
reveal that she did not like it, noted no accents of “forest floor,” and
was not seduced by its “interplay of plump grapes and jazzy oak.”168
Lastly, financial incentives select against middling reviews because
shilling and cherry-picking foster creation of extreme opinions. All
these tendencies lead to “regression to the extreme”: the propensity of
reputational data to emphasize, rather than eliminate, outlier
experiences over time.169
Product reviews consistently provide strong evidence of
regression to the extreme. One might expect that most products sold
on the market would follow some generalized, bell-shaped (Gaussian)
distribution—after all, very few products are really outstanding or
truly atrocious. Instead, most reviews on a large variety of online
platforms form a so-called “J-shaped distribution,” with most reviews

products have an average rating of at least four stars.171 In Airbnb
listings, the average rating is 4.7 stars.172 Studies repeatedly find
that middling reviews are rare and that even products with an

1268 WAKE FOREST LAW REVIEW [Vol. 54
Although the J-shaped distribution strongly supports the idea of
regression to the extreme, alternative explanations should also be
considered. One alternative is that market dynamics push low-
quality products out of the market.177 Because such pressures leave
only high-quality products on the market, reviews would be
(accurately) amassed in the right tail. While worthy of further
investigation, this explanation appears unlikely for a number of
reasons. Even if the products on the market are of high quality, there
should still be some middling reviews,178 and, in particular, there
should be more middling reviews than negative reviews.179 This
explanation suggests that high ranking is indicative of quality, but in
fact, rankings of identical products listed on different platforms are
often negatively correlated, such that a high ranking of the same
product in one place does not predict a high ranking elsewhere.180
A more general issue, and one that clouds other alternative
explanations, is that voluntary consumer reviews systematically
diverge from other types of evaluations. Across a variety of products,
professional testing of the same products listed on consumer websites
shows low correlation with consumer reviews.181 Not only does the
average quality differ, but a systematic difference in the distribution
of opinions also exists. While consumers’ reviews follow the noted J-
distribution, professional reviews of the same products follow a bell-
shaped distribution.182 One can almost hear the exasperation in the
voice of the researchers who concluded that “critics are more normal
than normal users.”183 If professional reviewers are competent, one
would expect a strong correlation between their judgments and
consumer reviews; the lack of such correlations suggests that at least
one of these sources of information is amiss. To test whether the
professional reviewers are actually inaccurate, consider the following
experiment. 218 participants, none of them a professional critic, were
177. A related theory is that consumers select products that they will probably
like and so it is expected that there will be a concentration of satisfied consumers.
See Nilesh Dalvi et al., Para ‘normal’ Activity: On the Distribution of Average
Ratings, 7 PROC. 7TH INT’L AAAI CONF. WEBLOGS & SOC. MEDIA 110, 111, 115
(2013). This theory, however, needs to explain why, in the absence of regression
to the extreme, there are so few middling reviews, which are to be expected in
light of possible consumer mistakes among similarly highly rated products.

3. Reputation Integrity
The last issue is the concern that even when consumers have an
incentive to report experiences, they may face adverse incentives
about the content of their reviews. For multiple reasons, individuals
may misstate the quality of their own experience. Consider, for
example, social pressures to conform, financial incentives, a desire to
avoid confrontation, an endowment effect, personal style, and other
similar considerations.186 All of these may lead individuals to report
their experiences more or less favorably than they actually were.
Threats to the integrity of reputational information are hard to
measure through data itself, but there is evidence that exposure to
the opinions of others will make others report more or less favorably
about their own experiences. Sociologist Ronald Burt noted, in the

context of gossip and stories told about others, that “[a]ccuracy is a
nicety more than a requirement for the stories.”187 Thus, he finds
significant echo chamber effects, where people shape the valance of
reputational information on the basis of context and audience rather
than merit.188 One such experimental finding is made by Tory
Higgins, who gave research subjects a description of a person called
Donald.189 The key was that the descriptions were very ambiguous
about whether Donald had positive or negative characteristics.190
Then, a confederate entered the room and said that he “kinda likes”
or “kinda dislikes” Donald, and asked the subjects for their opinion.191
The subjects then offered a distorted view of Donald that accorded
with the confederate’s disposition.192
* * *
In sum, the theory of the microfoundations of reputation suggests
that (1) there will be a trend in reputational data towards more
extreme reviews, (2) that the integrity of information will be
compromised, and (3) that the volume of reputational data will be
constrained by reputational sluggishness. The predictions of this
theory are consistent with available data, which show that significant
divergence exists between voluntary consumer reviews and other
measures of quality.193 While there is much to be desired in the way
of additional evidence, the existing data come from millions of
different products and across various platforms. All in all, the case
for distortions seems robust, given current knowledge.
C. Flawed Information, Flawed Decisions
When consumers make purchase decisions, one key type of
information they seek is data on the experiences of past consumers.
From the perspective of a prospective consumer, it is useful to know
how frequently the product or service resulted in a favorable
experience along some dimension (e.g., quality of food, promptness of
service, durability).194 Consumers seek to extrapolate from these data
to predict their own individual experience despite the obvious

differences in taste among individuals.195 Moreover, consumers care
about more than the average expected experience—whether it is good
or bad on average—but also about its variance, e.g., a phone that
generally functions perfectly but will on rare occasions explode could
have the same average rating as a phone that is consistently
mediocre.196 To the risk-averse consumer, the high-variance phone
would be inferior.197 To optimize decisions, then, consumers would
like to have access to the distribution of past consumer experiences,
rather than just their average.
Understood this way, the deleterious effect of sluggishness,
integrity, and regression to the extreme become apparent as they
make estimation less accurate. This loss of accuracy is because both
the quantity and quality of reputational information themselves are
jeopardized. The goal of this Part is to study these effects, using both
theory and a Monte Carlo simulation. One key insight from the
simulation, which is worth emphasizing here and throughout, is that
not all reputation failures are born equal. Some may lead to small
distortions that are largely inconsequential. Understanding the
circumstances under which reputation failures are most severe is key
to policymaking but, unfortunately, is largely outside the ambit of
this paper.
1. Informational Distortions
Sluggishness makes quality estimation difficult because it limits
the quantity of available data. Because consumers lack incentives to
share reputational information data exist for only a fraction of all
consumers. This limited quantity of information has two related
adverse effects. First, sluggishness leads outlier, unrepresentative
experiences to appear more common than they actually are—there is
not enough “regular use” data to contradict them.198 If, by chance
alone, one of these consumers had an extreme but unrepresentative
experience, an outlier, this will taint the perception of the product.
Sluggishness prolongs the time it takes for more reviews to
accumulate and correct the noise.199 Second, less information also

means less information regarding the distribution of experiences.
Even if the average is accurate, consumers also care about the
distribution, but sluggishness limits the volume of available
information.200
The problem of sluggishness is the same familiar problem of
surveys with small sample sizes. Figure 4 illustrates, using randomly
generated values, how much sluggishness can distort one’s
impression of products. Both graphs track the distribution of reviews
that were given by a sample of all consumers who chose to share their
reviews of the same product. In the top graph, only ten consumers
chose to do so, whereas in the bottom graph, one hundred consumers
shared their reviews. The dashed line indicates the full distribution
of all consumer experiences while the full line denotes the estimated
distribution based on the limited number of consumer reviews. As
can be seen, a smaller sample distorts one’s view of both the mean
and the distribution.

The next distortion concerns the quality of information and is
caused by regression to the extreme. Because incentives to report
experiences are weakest when the experiences are rote or bland, very
few reviews fall in the middle range, leaving only extreme reviews
reported.201 Trying to infer quality based on such a sample involves
a thorny statistical problem known as “middle censoring.” From a
statistical perspective, most methods of estimation assume that the

sample is taken from a random sample.202 If, instead, subjects self-
select—as is the case here—then this bias could undermine the
validity of statistical inferences. Figure 5 demonstrates the potential
implications of regression to the extreme. Similarly, the figure
collects, using randomly generated data, different consumer
reviews—with a sample of one hundred participating consumers—
but it omits the reviews of people with middling reviews who
presumably lacked an incentive to share. A prospective consumer,
seeking to decide whether to buy the product, only observes the filled
bars (the empty bars are not visible and illustrate the distribution of
unreported experiences). The full lines again mark the consumer’s
best guess about the mean and distribution based on this limited
information.203 The difference between the estimated mean and the
mean of all experiences (dashed) is highlighted by the arrow. As can
be seen, naïve estimation methods would yield widely inaccurate
outcomes.

end will be balanced by extreme results on the other end. This logic,
however, only applies to symmetric distributions—not the positively-
biased J distribution here.205
Finally, there are problems with the integrity of information.
Herding (or antiherding) is a highly path-dependent phenomenon.
Some products will appear to draw more and more favorable reviews,
but this can be the result of chance that led the group of first
consumers to have a favorable experience.206 Or, a product may
appear overly negative simply because a random group of first
consumers experienced some rare issues.
In sum, for a prospective consumer to accurately estimate the
quality of the underlying good, both the quantity and quality of
reputational information are essential. Sluggishness and regression
to the extreme make reputational information scarce and biased.
Consequently, the estimated mean and distribution of reported
reviews systematically diverge from the actual mean and
distribution, thus making them unreliable as sole guides for
consumer decision-making. The question still remains, however,
whether consumers can adjust for these distortions.
2. Overcoming Bias
Distorted information is likely to have a strong effect on
consumers. Survey after survey, consumers express strong
confidence in reputational information, describing it as a reliable
source of information.207 While it is unclear whether consumers take
reputation at face value, the level of their confidence is at least
suggestive of the former. Moreover, evidence shows a strong
monotonic relationship between ratings and sales—a half-star
increase in a restaurant rating resulting in a 19 percent higher
likelihood that the restaurant would sell out and another half-star
increase resulted in a 5 percent–9 percent increase in revenues.208
Consumers can also be affected by distorted information through a
205. See Hu et al, supra note 165, at 144 (“[T]he average is statistically
meaningful only when it is based on a unimodal distribution, or when it is based
on a symmetric bimodal distribution. However, since product systems have an
asymmetric bimodal (J-shaped) distribution, the average is a poor proxy of
product quality.”).

variety of behavioral, cognitive limitations,209 most notably
anchoring. Anchoring is the well-replicated psychological
phenomenon that describes how the introduction of arbitrary and
irrelevant numbers affects the outcomes of negotiations, evaluations,
and work performance ratings.210 If the consumer is exposed to
inflated reviews, then this can anchor an inflated sense of value.211
In addition, even if consumers learn that the data is biased, it is
unclear that they can effectively discount it.212 In a set of studies,
researchers investigated how individuals reacted when they learn
that they receive biased advice.213 Participants were asked to
estimate the cost of a house in Pittsburgh.214 To aid them, they were
given an estimate by a local realtor who knew the local market.215
However, the realtor also had an incentive to exaggerate her
estimate, because her commission was based on the final sale price.216
Surprisingly, the control group that was unaware of the realtor’s bias
had more accurate estimates than the treatment group which was
informed that the realtor had a conflict of interest.217 Finally, even if
consumers were capable of mentally detaching from these effects, it

be a bank teller than be both a bank teller and a feminist.220 But this,
of course, cannot be. Obviously there are more bank tellers than there
are bank tellers who are also feminists, but still, people find it difficult
to intuit statistical judgments.221
Consequently, the law is generally skeptical of consumers’
abilities to correct biased data, even in situations where consumers
may be aware of the existence of distortions and where third-party
services may be used to correct them.222 Such are, for example, the
limits on contractual misrepresentation, investor fraud through
pump-and-dump strategies, false advertising, defamation, and false
lights. The pump-and-dump scheme is especially telling because it
involves the dissemination of wrong reputational information about
firms.223 Even though investors may be thought to be, on average,
somewhat more sophisticated than consumers and even though it
may be clear to those investors that pump-and-dump schemes take
place, the law still chooses to proscribe such activities, fearing that
consumers will not be able to compensate for such misleading
strategies adequately.224
While it is clear that reputation failure could have a strong effect
on most consumers, in the rest of this Part, I focus on a harder
question. Can consumers—at least those that are rational,
sophisticated, and informed—overcome these distortions? After all,
it is fair to assume that many consumers at least suspect that
reputational information should not be taken at face value. This Part
investigates these issues, using both examples and computer
simulations to evaluate three central consumer strategies: cardinal
evaluations—i.e., choosing a product based on its score or mean;
ordinal ranking—i.e., choosing the relatively better-rated product;
and evaluating qualitative information—i.e., choosing on the basis of
the content of reviews.
Cardinal Evaluations. Suppose that a consumer is trying to
estimate the quality of a hypothetical product based on the valence of
reviews. She knows that reviews in the middle, rated two or three

truncated sample is a risky proposition, doubly so when the sample is
small due to sluggishness, and triply so when the data is misstated
due to integrity bias. Still, consumers often try to estimate quality on
the basis of review valence, especially by limiting their searches to
products above a certain mean.
Ordinal Comparisons. Suppose that the consumer reluctantly
accepts that means are problematic, and instead seeks to compare
among products, reasoning that if all are subject to biases, at least
the comparison of the means would reveal which one is superior.227
The following Table describes two products that the consumer is
trying to compare; the shaded area is middling information that is not
available to her. On the basis of available information, she takes the
mean of product A to be 2.8 and that of product B to be also 2.8. She
also notes that they both have the same distribution of reviews. She
concludes that the two products are of equal value. Based on your
knowledge of the shaded information, is this a correct conclusion?
TABLE 1. ORDINAL COMPARISON WITH TRUNCATED DATA
To give a sense of the scope of mistakes based on interproduct
comparisons, I conducted various Monte Carlo simulations, reported
in Figures 9, 10, and 11.228 Monte-Carlo simulations are a computer-
assisted technique used in finance, physics, and computer science to
track complex interactions in domains where the parameter space is
possible, the accuracy of such process and its transferability across domains

difference (Student’s T-Test) are unhelpful when the sample is not randomly
chosen. See MOORE & MCCABE, supra note 202, at 463. Nonparametric tests also
depend on various assumptions that may not hold in these contexts. Id.

given the large volume of trials, this deviation will not affect any of the

large and uncertain.229 By running thousands of simulated
experiments, each with random deviations, the experimenter can
learn of trends in the data.230 Methodologically, the Monte Carlo
simulation is akin to a quasi experiment; it is useful in demonstrating
the existence of certain phenomena and indicating their potential
magnitude, although it is not at the epistemic level of natural
experiments as it only studies possibilities rather than actual
quantities.231
The first simulation generated two products of arbitrarily chosen
mean quality (although they shared all other statistical features).
Each product was “tried” by one hundred different “consumers,”
which means that each consumer has a random experience based on
the quality of the product. The higher mean product was more likely
to generate a favorable experience. After trying the product, each
consumer could report the experience by rating it from one to five
stars in half-star increments. Because of regression to the extreme,
the consumers are coded not to share experiences in the range of two
to three stars. Once all the information accumulates, a new consumer
comes and tries to decide which product to purchase on the basis of
interproduct comparisons. She chooses the one with the higher
reported mean, based on the reasoning noted above. The code then
counts every instance where the consumer was misled into choosing
the inferior product. This process, for the same products, was
repeated ten thousand times. This gives an account of the frequency
of mistakes, given products of different means. To see how a higher
difference would affect the frequency of mistakes, the simulation then
ran the same process but increased the mean of product B by a slight
amount. The following figures report this simulation, and two others,
explained below.

FIGURE 11. DIFFERENCE IN STANDARD DEVIATION
Figure 9 shows how the mean quality of the underlying goods
affects consumer mistakes.232 For products that are not clearly
distinguishable, i.e., they have a somewhat similar mean, consumer
mistakes are widespread. For example, if the difference in mean is
0.1 stars, then under the parameters of the simulation consumers
would choose the wrong products in 25 percent of the cases. For
products that are even harder to distinguish, with only a 0.05 star-
difference, the ratio of mistakes rises to 35 percent. On the flip side,
the more different the products are, the fewer mistakes consumers
commit, despite regression to the extreme. When the difference is
0.25 stars, the ratio of mistakes falls below 10 percent, and when it is
0.5 stars, it mostly disappears.
Figure 10 reports the same simulation, but this time it holds the
mean difference constant at 0.3 stars and only varies the sale volume.
One product is reviewed throughout by one hundred consumers,
whereas the other is reviewed by a variable number of consumers.
When the second product is reviewed by only fifteen consumers, the
ratio of mistakes raises to about 20 percent. This is important, in part
because the difference in means is relatively significant (0.3 stars),
and in part because most products have very few reviews, making this
scenario likely.233
232. Part of the distortion of reputational information is also due to the use of
integers or half integers (i.e., a consumer reports a 2.5-star review, whereas the
actual experience is 2.34). Despite its flaws, the integer ranking system is almost
universal.
233. As noted, the median product only has two reviews. See supra note 157
and accompanying text.

1284 WAKE FOREST LAW REVIEW [Vol. 54
Finally, Figure 11 reports the same simulation but this time
holding the mean and sale volume equal, and only changing the
variability of experiences. From a consumer perspective, in choosing
between two products with equal means, the one with the lower
variability would be preferred due to risk aversion. Here we find the
most considerable degree of mistakes. When one product yields
consistent experiences and the other variable ones, the ratio of
mistake is very high—when the variance of one product is 0.1 stars,
but the variance of the other is 0.5 stars, consumers mistakenly prefer
the inferior product in over 80 percent of the cases. Only when both
products are highly variable does the ratio of mistakes start to fall.
Taken together, and under some important caveats, these
simulations demonstrate the potential scope of consumer errors given
reputation failure. At the same time, the simulations also
demonstrated a broad range of cases where reputation failure is
unlikely—specifically, environments where there is a great difference
in product quality, when the sale volume is large, and when quality
variability is large or constant across products. This conclusion is
important in evaluating the social harm and the contexts in which it
is likely to arise from reputational distortions. An important caveat,
however, is that these simulations are based on stylized examples and
use arbitrarily chosen parametric values. This limits the
interpretation of the results reported here. On the other hand, real-
life considerations tend to increase the problematic nature of reviews
relative to the simulations. For example, satisfied consumers may be
more or less likely to report their experiences than disgruntled
consumers.234 After all, the tendency to complain is different from the
tendency to praise, and spite is not simply gratitude multiplied by
negative one. Other practical complications involve consumers
ascribing different meaning to star reviews (for some, a four-star
review means high-valence, while for others, it will indicate a
negative experience); the possibility that some products will have
bimodal or other nonstandard distributions; the dynamic effect
caused by buyers experimenting less with low-reviewed products; and
firms investing different amounts of efforts in shilling and cherry-
picking. These considerations would tend to make not only the
simulations less reliable but also any quantitative approach to the
data.
Qualitative Analysis. Suppose now that the consumer seeks to
only read reviews and focus only on qualitative content. In particular,
she is trying to decide between two brands of toilet paper sold on one
234. See Interview with anonymous medium-sized seller on Amazon of
organic products for babies (Jan. 19, 2018) (claiming that disgruntled consumers
are more prone to writing reviews than very happy ones); cf. Chrysanthos

platform. It turns out that there are almost 8000 different reviews
for the two brands.235 How long would it take her to read them all?
How confident should she be in her ability to spot fake reviews?
Suppose that she finds some regularity in reviews that she deems
suspect, so she dismisses them; how long would it take for financially
motivated sellers to produce reviews that avoid the pattern?
Stated more generally, qualitative analysis does not scale, and
trying to peruse all the reviews of more than a few products can often
be unmanageable. Yet, limiting attention to a few potential products
is also unworkable—what would be the selection criteria? If it is
reputation (e.g., only products with 4.5 stars), this runs into exactly
the same issues discussed above. Moreover, the ability to spot fake
reviews—consumer overconfidence notwithstanding—is in fact quite
limited.236 Finally, even if a consumer can find a useful guiding
heuristic, it will be exploitable. If consumers only trust the reviews
of serial reviewers, for example, a seller may derive a sizeable
financial benefit from bribing this serial reviewer.237 If consumers
mostly care about negative reviews, for another example, then a seller
will pay to invest heavily in shilling against competitors’ products.238
If consumers mostly care about the volume of sales, the seller may
artificially inflate sales by giving away products.239 Stated more
generally, heuristics beget loopholes which beget exploitation by
opportunistic sellers.

To summarize, this Part demonstrated how the microfoundations
of reputation result in informational distortions. Because the reasons
to share information are often private and self-serving, three types of
information distortions emerge—sluggishness, regression to the

extreme, and integrity bias. As a result, peer-to-peer reputational
information tends to provide a false sense of the true quality of the
underlying product. While consumers can try to account for these
distortions, many will lack the requisite sophistication, and even
consumers who do account for the distortions might not be able to do
so given the potentially corrupting effect of the distortions. This is
not to say that distortions are always strong or that consumer
heuristics are not helpful. Still, reputation failures have important
normative implications which I now move to discuss.
IV. LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF REPUTATION FAILURE
What does the law have to say or do about reputation failures? I
start with the most direct legal interventions that are needed when
the symptoms of reputation failure are present and acute (which is
not always the case). I then move to outline a more ambitious
program: Reputation-by-Regulation. The key idea is to shift attention
from symptoms—such as consumer mistakes—to causes. Legal
institutions can be improved to facilitate the creation of quality
reputational information, thus mitigating some of the root causes of
reputation failure.
A. Reputation Failure and Contemporary Debates in Contracts
and Torts
There are many who call for deregulation on the basis of the rise
of reputational information.240 There has also recently been growing
support among sharing-market enthusiasts, liberals and
conservatives alike, who believe that online platforms open avenues
for effective self-regulation “outside the law.”241
Recognizing reputation failures highlights the dangers of relying
on existing market mechanisms. Naïve reliance on reputation-based
market mechanisms often leads to perverse outcomes in the presence
of acute reputation failures. When consumers select products on the
basis of biased or distorted reputational information, they are likely
to make persistent mistakes242—a social deadweight loss.243 These
mistakes have negative dynamic effects because they make the
production of quality products less rewarding and the production of
unsafe products more rewarding.244 Such a dynamic can devolve into

2019] LIMITS OF MARKET DISCIPLINE 1287
what economists call a “lemon market,” where sellers decide to stop
selling quality goods even though consumers would want to buy them
because consumers cannot distinguish between high and low-quality
goods.245
In the presence of persistent and systematic consumer errors,
recent scholarship has shown that some type of regulation can be
welfare-enhancing even when accounting for the limitations of a top-
down regulator.246 If sellers cannot be trusted to meet consumer
expectations, then setting boundaries for permissible dealings may
improve matters.247 Thus, laws and regulations such as lemon laws,
implied warranties, safety audits and recalls, restaurant safety
grading, and many other measures may be needed more than critics
would admit. It also helps draw the boundaries of the sharing
economy and the continued need for traditional reputational sources,
such as professional critics or professional review media (Consumer
Reports, for example).
In sum, reputation failure fits in the family of market failures. It
is a market friction that can justify intervention in consumer markets
in order to improve consumer and social welfare. Of course,
reputation failures do not give a carte blanche for regulation. These
failures vary in scope and severity and in some cases, the costs of
product regulation by an outside regulator may outweigh the
benefits.248 Still, modern debates on deregulation—especially those
involving the sharing economy—fail to recognize that reputation is
subject to systematic failures.249 Bringing this insight into modern
debates should temper some deregulatory trends.
B. Reputation-by-Regulation
Today, the regulatory schema is one of competition between legal
ordering and market ordering “outside the law.”250 Policymakers are
told to choose between heavy-handed regulation and unbridled trust

in the market.251 The analysis presented here suggests a novel third
way, a complementarity model between these two options. The key
insight is that the law has an active role to play ex ante in designing
the rules of the game, such that the information that flows to the
market is more reliable and abundant. I name this family of
strategies Reputation-by-Regulation to indicate how closely related
reputation is to regulation. Rather than an organic and “natural”
outgrowth of market relations, reputation is deeply influenced by
background legal institutions. Drawing awareness to Reputation-by-
Regulation helps expose the role legal institutions play in the
development of reputational information and highlights alternative
institutional strategies. The rest of this Part suggests a menu of five
options that illustrate how the law can take various degrees of
involvement in removing reputational bottlenecks.
To provide some initial motivation to Reputation-by-Regulation,
it is worth noting that when reputation works it has an important
advantage over standard disclosures rules in that it communicates
with consumers in their own terms, thus avoiding some of the
critiques brought against mandatory disclosure over the last few
years.252 As a peer-to-peer mechanism, consumers directly transmit
the information that they find pertinent using their language and
emphasizing their use patterns. For example, consumer comments
on fuel economy can track normal use patterns more accurately than
the abstract categories of pure city or highway miles required by
law.253 Similarly, annual percentage interest rates that credit issuers
must disclose may be less intelligible to consumers than actual
examples of costs per use.254 As these examples highlight, there is
great potential in Reputation-By-Regulation.
1. Leveraging Market Players: The Role of Reputational
Platforms
It goes without saying that market players will often have an
incentive and ability to deal with market problems themselves. In
the last two decades, for example, reputational platforms specializing
in the aggregation of peer-to-peer reputational information have
blossomed.255 Such platforms have realized the value of “reputation
for reputation,” i.e., the value of garnering consumer trust which can

then be monetized using various business models.256 Although it may
seem natural now, in the early days of the internet it was far from
evident that a shopping website would want to display information
that could portray some of its traded products in a negative light.257
The sentiment at the time was that “[l]etting consumers rant about
products in public was a recipe for retail suicide.”258 It was also
incredible that consumers could trust the advertised opinions of
complete strangers.259 Still, a small online bookseller by the name of
Amazon took a bold step and adopted a system of consumer
feedback.260 The rest, is, well, history.261
Reputational platforms are metaregulators and, within their
limits, should be enlisted to address some of the problems of
reputation failure. Given that consumer trust is a source of the “new
oil”—internet traffic—platforms have an incentive to develop
metareputation for being honest curators of reputational
information.262 Indeed, some platforms have already taken
voluntarily action to stamp out fake reviews.263 Amazon uses a
variety of algorithms to detect suspect reviews, prohibits the
provision of incentives-for-reviews, and sues violators.264 Moreover,
Amazon also lists some reviews as those done by “Verified
Purchasers” to further limit manipulation, although this has led to a
cottage industry of payments for purchases coupled with fake
reviews.265

To the extent that such systems work, they are desirable and
helpful. But reputational platforms are also limited in their policing
powers. For the most part, platforms only rely on contractual
agreements between themselves, sellers, and buyers.266 Thus, their
ability to investigate and sanction fake reviews is very limited.
Platforms also risk harmful public relations implications if they take
actions that consumers deem too aggressive.267 Moreover, platforms’
ability to correct consumer misstatements, investigate cherry-
picking, or validate information is also limited. There is not much
TripAdvisor can do to enforce its ban of reviews by family members of
an owner’s hotel.268
A deeper problem is that platforms do not always have the
incentive to act in the public interest. Platforms face a conflict of
interest because profits and sales can be in tension with consumer
trust. The existence and type of a conflict depends on the specific
business model, but any platform that profits from the transactions it
facilitates may be tempted to promote higher margin items.269 As a
result, the platform may list these products first, suppress negative
reviews of its own products, or otherwise manipulate the market for
its own advantage.270 Even if gross violations of consumer trust can
be detected, small violations of consumer trust—“‘fudging’ on the
margin”—will be all but impossible to detect by consumers.271 When
Amazon, for example, lists its own products prominently on the first
page and before higher-rated products, it trades off some of the trust
consumers place in it, the trust that it will feature best products first,
against its own profits.272 Uber, facing pressures from drivers,

systematically censors reviews from passengers who give four-star or
less reviews more than a few times.273 A large class action was
brought and settled against Angie’s List in which the primary
allegation was that Angie’s List reviewer ratings were influenced by
payments from providers.274 Yelp has been the subject of extensive
litigation for allegedly manipulating reviews against businesses that
were not willing to pay advertising fees.275 According to an
investigation by the Wall Street Journal, the Federal Trade
Commission (“FTC”) received hundreds of complaints against Yelp
alleging that businesses received unfair reviews after refusing to
advertise on the website.276 Another platform, Consumer Affairs, has
similarly been subject to litigation for allegedly presenting reviews of
certain paying members in a more favorable light.277 A ProPublica
report also suggests that Amazon may be unfairly manipulating
listings in order to promote its own goods.278
Exacerbating the conflict of interest is the right courts granted to
platforms to almost arbitrarily curate reviews. The Ninth Circuit
recently considered whether a platform could arbitrarily choose the
reviews it presents to consumers.279 The court held that the reviewee
has no right to have any review posted at all and as such, cannot
compel the platform to publish reviews it does not want to publish.280
This decision licenses platforms to present reviews according to their
own discretion—with a minimal check on their behavior.281

1292 WAKE FOREST LAW REVIEW [Vol. 54
because screening of reviews, often done algorithmically, relies on
necessarily opaque standards since disclosing the algorithm would
invite abuse by sellers.282 At the same time, these opaque algorithms
give the platform more power to abuse consumer trust.283
To the extent regulators are worried about these issues, a few
options to leverage market players present themselves: regulation,
investigation, and accreditation.
a. Regulating Platforms
On the regulatory side, consumer agencies and legislators can
create a unified set of rules that governs what constitutes fair and
reasonable treatment of consumer peer-to-peer reputational
information.284 A platform should not promote its own products, or
higher-margin products, when it presents consumer-sourced
reputational information. A clear first step in this direction is to
revise the holding that platforms are free to arbitrarily curate
reviews.285 Additionally, platforms should be considered as forum
providers for speech, limiting their ability to arbitrarily censor
reviews. Platforms should also be required to publish their review
curation, aggregation, and display standards. Another possibility is
to require platforms to release certain key statistical information
such as the volume of sales. Additionally, platforms might be
required to display the ratio of consumers who did not rate the
product to those who did in order to aid consumers (or assistive
technology) in drawing better statistical inferences. Alternatively,
they might simply be required to create and follow their own choice
of standards of regulation—thus creating metaregulation of sorts,
relying on the platforms to find the right balance of substantive rules.
A useful source of inspiration (although with some caution) is the
evolving international standards of platform regulation developed by
the International Consumer Protection Enforcement Network
(“ICPEN”), a network of consumer protection authorities from nearly
sixty countries.286 The ICPEN standards include disclosure

standards governing platforms’ methods for curating and aggregating
reviews, requirements for platform functionality of review sorting
according to consumer criteria, and obligations to present negative
reviews of a platforms’ own products.287 It should be noted, however,
that some of these regulations can run into potential First
Amendment constraints.288 At the same time, their usefulness and
importance merits serious consideration.
b. Policing Platforms
To ensure the integrity of reputational information, it may be
necessary for an external agency to regularly inspect and police the
inner workings of reputational platforms.289 This is already done, to
some extent, by the FTC.290 However, there are still some important
informational gaps.291 The agency should first have access to all
reviews posted to the platform, including their timestamps, IP
addresses, and external information relating to the product price and
type. Then, it should access the (anonymized) reviewer data itself—
past transactions and past review history—in order to identify shell
accounts. Then, the agency should trace typical consumer searches
and the corresponding results: what products are featured, in which
order, and by which criteria. Finally, the agency should review the
platform’s algorithms for identifying faux reviews and test their
operation. Such investigations are crucial given that many of the
processes for collecting and curating reputational information are
opaque and that opaqueness may be necessary to avoid manipulation
by other market players. In addition to audits, the agency should also
investigate claims of unfair treatment by market players.
c. Platform Accreditation
Accreditation is perhaps the least intensive form of regulatory
intervention. Accreditation will involve using a badge to indicate that
the platform is monitored by the agency and that it complies with its
own standards. Receiving accreditation may be entirely voluntary,

thus sidestepping any potential First Amendment concerns.292 Of
course, if the agency finds at any time that the platform is not in
compliance, it may strip its badge.
Receiving a badge would garner consumer trust. Such a system
can thus be valuable even if it is entirely voluntary because it will be
in the platform’s interest to receive accreditation. Remember that
consumers may be suspicious even when platforms act honestly
because the platform has superior information regarding its own
internal practices. The badge would allow platforms to credibly
communicate their honesty to the public.
2. Professional Publications
An alternative or supplement to a system of accreditation
involves using professional rating agencies and publications. Some
successful examples include Consumer Reports, US News, PC
Magazine, Michelin Restaurant Review, and the New York Times
Book Review section.293 Like reputation platforms, these services are
also premised on the idea of a reputation for reputation, i.e.,
monetizing consumer trust in their reputation production services.294
Moreover, they have some advantages over amateur consumer
reviews in that they have both the facilities and knowledge to
extensively test products.295 Such publications are demonstrably
valuable, as consumers continue to use them despite their cost and
the rise of free online consumer-generated information.296 Indeed,
292. The use of a government agency, rather than a market player, is
motivated by the infinite regress problem noted by Brian Galle, whereby
consumers might worry that the contracted auditor is itself compromised. See

SOCIAL ENTERPRISE LAW 7–8 (forthcoming); see also Oren Perez et al., The

2019] LIMITS OF MARKET DISCIPLINE 1295
their continued existence is a possible testament to the existence of
reputation failure in peer-to-peer reputational information.297
Still, reliance on such publications is not without its limitations.
Professional critics do not always care about the same things as less-
sophisticated consumers.298 Professional publications can only cover
a sliver of the product-space, and it is unlikely that they can ever
approach the comprehensiveness of consumer-sourced reviews.299
But, most acutely, as consumers place more confidence in such
publications, it becomes more profitable for sellers to bribe those
reviewers to publish favorable reviews.300
The government may increase the use of such services by either
subsidizing them or otherwise requiring testing in some areas.
Notably, the state already supports these publications by protecting
their copyright and intellectual property. Such protections can be
extended through broader, more aggressive copyright protections,
subject—of course—to a full cost-benefit analysis.
3. Fighting Fake Reviews
As noted earlier, fake reviews are the scourge of the reputation
system. The more consumers use and trust reviews, the more it pays
to invest in creating fake reviews.301 And while reputation platforms
have some incentive to fight fake reviews, their efforts tend to fall
short.302
A useful market-based solution here is the leveraging of a
competitor’s interest. Importantly, I propose that fake reviews will

be considered a form of false advertising and subject to the Lanham
Act of 1940 or state-level antitrust laws, which permit competitors to
bring private suits against sellers for posting fake reviews.303 Some
courts have authorized the use of this provision to impose liability for
fake reviews.304 This tool is helpful—competitors may lose market
share when a firm fakes its own reviews or use reviews to attack
another—but it is also quite limited. Only competitors may employ
this tool, and they themselves have limited resources to investigate
claims. More fundamentally, the cost of fighting false advertising by
a competitor is private, but the benefit accrues to all the firms that
compete in the space.
In contrast to private market players, the FTC, the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau, and some state agencies have broad
investigative powers.305 These agencies can investigate fraud and
have both the authority and resources to do so effectively.306 They
can also use their powers to fine market players for unlawful
behavior, creating the strong deterrence needed to effectively combat
the generation of fake reviews.307 Importantly, fake reviews can be
considered a form of false advertising and subject to the Lanham Act
or state-level antitrust laws,308 although the exact mechanisms are
beyond the scope of this Article.309 Reputation failure provides strong
reasons for further investment in resources in these measures.
One issue in combating fake reviews is the First Amendment
protection of speech. Historically, the First Amendment was not
thought to cover fraudulent speech.310 In In re R.M.J.,311 the Supreme
Court held that states are free to regulate advertising that is
inherently misleading.312 And while the recent decision in United
States v. Alvarez313 allowed some protection of fraudulent speech in
the context of the Stolen Valor Act, such protection is very limited.314

Fake reviews are by their nature misleading, thus it seems that well-
tailored regulations meant to apply this standard would be justified.
In addition, the law should limit businesses’ ability to offer incentives
for favorable reviews, i.e., cherry-picking consumers. Such an
approach could sidestep many of the thorny constitutional tensions
while advancing the goal of combating reputation failure.
To be clear, it is not expected that regulatory action alone will be
capable of eliminating fake reviews. Still, decisive regulatory action
can significantly curtail the profitability of this practice. It should
also be noted that investing in some of the other measures proposed
here would also be helpful in fighting fake reviews. It is much easier
and cheaper to cultivate a favorable view of one’s restaurant when
competing with a handful of reviews; it is much more complex to do
so when there are dozens of reviews.
4. Fostering Positive Incentives
As argued earlier, because reputation is a public good, consumers
often lack sufficient incentive to create it—a problem most acute with
respect to middling experiences and unpopular opinions. The nascent
law regulating consumer benefits exhibits considerable confusion
about this basic point and takes an overly strong stance against
incentivizing reviews.315 Here, again, the microfoundations
framework helps delineate the proper limits of providing incentives
and behavioral nudges to consumers.
To promote transparency in the market and curb false
advertising, the FTC announced new guidelines in 2015 that regulate
incentivized reviews.316 The context of these guidelines is facially
reasonable: the ascendency of social media has created a new form of
endorsement—reviews by “influencers,” or individuals who amass
many followers. Companies are estimated to be spending billions of
dollars paying influencers to endorse products on their social media
accounts.317 In response, the FTC sought to require influencers to
disclose their financial interests.318
The result, however, is the proverbial throwing out the baby with
the bathwater. Consumers need incentives and nudges to produce
accurate reputational information, which are outcomes of consumers
not internalizing the benefits of reputational information.319 Direct
incentives consist of free products, discounts, payments, and
commissions. Nudges, such as prompts to rate the previous

experience before engaging in a new transaction or reminders to rate
and review, also increase the creation of consumer reputational
information.320
Despite the importance of such incentives and nudges, the FTC
guidelines impose onerous disclosure requirements that are triggered
almost indiscriminately without attention to context. For example, if
a restaurant chooses to offer free meals on its opening night so as to
incentivize traffic, every person dining there has to disclose her
financial stakes when discussing her experience—even if the
restaurant never asked for any review, much less a favorable one.321
The same goes for a “dollar-off” coupon, sweepstakes promotions, or
even charity donations.322 The imposition of such broad duties is not
only onerous but it also has unwanted secondary effects. Like the
harried student highlighting the entire textbook, there is danger in
indiscriminate disclosure. Using the same disclosure standards for
content-neutral and content-biased reviews can be misleading. Even
worse, mandating such disclosures may exacerbate the problem of
regression to the extreme. Research finds that disclosing financial
incentives may create a “moral license” to exaggeratedly extol the
virtues of the product.323
There is a readily available alternative. The developing
international standard permits the use of content-neutral
incentives.324 Under this standard, businesses may legitimately offer
incentives to reputation creators if it ensures that the resulting
opinion arises independently of the incentive.325 A content-neutral
incentive may include offering free products under an agreement that
clearly states that the user has full discretion over the content of the
review and that future promotions will not be made contingent on her
response.326 Or businesses can provide discounts to consumers who
review a product, so long as the review is anonymized by a trusted
third-party.327 Research on the effect of such incentives is scant, but
it suggests that content-neutral reviews are effective. A recent study
compared incentivized reviews to organic ones, both qualitatively and

quantitatively.328 Not surprisingly, incentivized reviews put less
emphasis on price; but importantly, there was no difference in rating
between the content-neutral-incentivized and organic reviews.329
Thus, incentives can have desirable effects for creating reliable
reputational information.
5. Controlling Costs: First Amendment and Reputation
The last set of solutions builds on the key insight that the costs
of reputation generation are wholly private, but the benefits are
partly public. This Subpart advocates the expansion of free speech
safeguards provided by the First Amendment to consumer reviews.
Today, with increasing frequency, lawsuits are brought against
consumers for providing reviews.330 Businesses latch onto factual
inaccuracies (some small or innocent) and sue using a variety of
doctrines including defamation, tortious interference, injurious
falsehoods (commercial disparagement),331 and false light.332 One
report finds that “negative reviews have become the subject of dozens
of lawsuits across Texas in recent years,” and there is a growing sense
that this happens across the nation.333 The consequences of such
lawsuits can be dire: a woman complaining online about the services
of her divorce attorney was charged with $350,000 in damages.334
Admittedly, such judgments are relatively exceptional. However, the
threat is not just liability but also litigation. Indeed, according to
Professor Lyrissa Lydsky, a primary reason such lawsuits are
brought is not to collect damages but to silence.335 And this menacing
effect is amplified by consistent media coverage of such lawsuits.336

1300 WAKE FOREST LAW REVIEW [Vol. 54
To compound the matter further, in handling these lawsuits,
consumers face the common risk of de-anonymization.337 Nor is state
legislation very helpful. Anti-Strategic Lawsuits Against Public
Participation (“Anti-SLAPP”) legislation meant to combat abusive
lawsuits is not broadly adopted or consistently applied.338 Finally,
even slight increases in cost can dissuade reviewers (reduce the
number of reviews). One experiment, for example, tested how small
costs affect behavior and found that “[r]emoving a cost of only
$0.25 . . . leads to a more than 50 percentage point increase in the
frequency of rating.”339
Some examples might be helpful in appreciating the chilling
effect of litigation risk. One New Jersey consumer, Jane Perez,
complained online about her contractor, stating, “My home was
damaged: the ‘work’ had to be re-accomplished . . . he invoiced me for
work not even performed.”340 The contractor sued Perez for $750,000
in damages for defamation.341 The contractor finally lost the suit, but
along the way, Ms. Perez deleted her review and had to defend herself
through an expensive five-day jury trial.342 Or, take the case of Las
Vegas consumer Pamela Boling.343 She sought the assistance of a tax
professional to help demonstrate her economic hardships to tax
authorities. However, the service she received was below her
expectations, so she turned to Yelp and wrote a review concluding
“this is MALPRACTICE!”344 Soon after, the business filed a
defamation lawsuit against her. To ward off the lawsuit, she spent
$40,852 in litigation costs.345 Although she ultimately won the case

and recovered some costs, the process was long, risky, and caused her
to redact her original opinion—suppressing a view that the court
deemed legitimate.346 Finally, consider the case of Stephen Glover,
who posted a negative review about his lawyer, claiming that he was
the “[w]orst ever” because he yelled at him to “GOOGLE IT!” in
response to a question and otherwise acted unprofessionally.347 This
review led to a two-year defamation lawsuit and appeal where Glover,
finally, prevailed.
The chilling effect of lawsuits is related to the lack of legal
safeguards to protect consumer speech.348 Under prevailing
standards, businesses can bring a defamation lawsuit against
consumers if the review contains some factual inaccuracies.349 From
a First Amendment perspective, some courts have been willing to
accept that reviews are a matter of public interest and therefore
should be protected under the First Amendment, but the scope of
protection is slim. In a recent case, the Oregon Supreme Court
explained that reviews are protected only if “a reasonable factfinder
could not conclude that [the consumer’s] review implies an assertion
of fact.”350 In effect, the decision underscores the costs borne by
consumers who pen reviews. Beyond the possibility of an
anticonsumer mistake by judges or juries,351 it is simply difficult for
most consumers—especially those who are emotional—to write
reviews that clearly communicate an opinion or avoid any factual
inaccuracies given inevitable gaps in recollection, errors in phrasing,
or strong emotions.352
If we recognize the social importance of consumer reviews, the
weak positive incentives to produce them, and the risk of liability or
even just litigation, a few solutions present themselves. One
moderate solution is greater adoption and broader implementation of
anti-SLAPP legislation.353 This legislation is useful because it
imposes costs on strategic lawsuits by businesses. But it is also
limited. To win such a suit, the consumer has to prove that the

business does not stand a good chance of prevailing, which—given the
current legal standards and the limited resources consumers have—
is tough.354 Other options also include the use of legal aid subsidies
or crowdfunding to defend consumers, arbitration, and other forms of
alternative dispute resolution, and agency audits.355
The most powerful solution would be a First Amendment
protection in the form of a consumer review privilege.356 Today,
political speech enjoys broad protections under the New York Times
v. Sullivan357 standard.358 Despite the recognition that protecting
political speech could foster false allegations, the Supreme Court
expressed a strong preference for the promotion of speech on matters
involving public figures.359 As a result, the Court ruled that unless
plaintiffs can show malice on the defendant’s side, a lawsuit cannot
be brought.360 As a result, such lawsuits are relatively rare. Future
cases, most notably Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders,361
emphasized that issues of public interest are also deserving of greater
protection.362 This is explained on the basis of the positive externality
of speech, a feature that consumer reviews also share.363
A consumer review privilege would still permit businesses to
bring lawsuits against false reviews, but they will have to be able to
show malice on the consumer side. Such a privilege will greatly
reduce the business ability to strategically drag consumers to court.364
The privilege would also protect consumers in the lawsuit itself,
although given the high win rate consumers enjoy today, this effect is
admittedly small. Additionally, this privilege will considerably limit

the ability of businesses to de-anonymize consumers. As a result, this
privilege would significantly reduce the cost of legal liability making
speech more attractive on the margin. Indeed, existing privileges are
also justified by the positive externalities of speech, so this privilege
would be a natural extension.
Some have objected to protecting consumers’ reviews on the
ground that it encourages reckless or deliberate lies by consumers
against businesses.365 However, objections of this sort have not
sufficiently accounted for the public value of reputation or its
microfoundations.366 They assume that consumers share a desire to
besmirch the reputation of firms but say little about why (or when)
consumers care to tell the truth in the first place. Moreover, they
have not analyzed the dynamic equilibrium that emerges from a lax
defamation regime. In short, people tend to place less trust in
assertions that are made in the absence of defamation law and so the
negative impact of lies would be much abated.367 Thus, the opposition
to consumer review privileges should be revisited. At the very least,
scholars and policymakers should adopt a more skeptical approach to
the social utility of defamation laws, and courts should better
understand the chilling effect of their rulings, even when the case is
finally disposed of in favor the consumer.
V. CONCLUSION
Reputation is fundamental to the operation of many markets.
When reputation works, it works extremely well; it disciplines sellers
at a low cost, saving the need for courts and lawyers. But reputation
can also fail. Today, many are too excited by the rise of the sharing
economy to see that the microfoundations on which it rests are
faltering.
Earlier scholarship—in law, economics, sociology, and biology—
has trusted reputation to work well, at least in certain domains. This
Article explained why careful analysis of the microfoundations of
reputation—the microincentives that lead individuals to create and
share reputational information—suggests the potential of reputation
failures. Such failures have a significant bearing on future
policymaking and contracts scholarship in particular. Most directly,
it invites greater skepticism towards current trends to deregulate
consumer transactions on the basis of faith in the internal regulatory
power of market forces.

The most ambitious goal of this Article is to carve a path for
future regulation of consumer markets—Reputation-by-Regulation,
i.e., the use of laws and institutions to improve the flow of
reputational information to the market. This approach holds
considerable promise. Like mandatory disclosures, the law of
reputation seeks to improve markets indirectly by providing
consumers with reliable information that would allow them to make
informed purchasing decisions.368 By identifying and removing
reputational failures, the law can increase consumer welfare without
mandating any specific set of terms, thus preserving autonomy and
freedom of contract.369 Addressing reputation failure should be the
cornerstone of future consumer policy.
