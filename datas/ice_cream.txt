Making homemade ice cream is possible
with or without a machine. The simplest method uses only three ingredients and does not require churning, resulting in a rich, velvety, "no-churn" ice cream.
3-Ingredient No-Churn Method (Easiest)
This method produces a soft, creamy, and scoopable ice cream.
Ingredients:

    2 cups heavy whipping cream (very cold)
    1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk (chilled)
    2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Instructions:

    Whip the Cream: In a large bowl, beat the cold heavy cream with a hand mixer or stand mixer until stiff peaks form (about 2-3 minutes).
    Combine Ingredients: In a separate smaller bowl, whisk together the condensed milk and vanilla extract.
    Fold: Gently fold the condensed milk mixture into the whipped cream in batches, being careful not to deflate the mixture.
    Add Mix-ins (Optional): Fold in chocolate chips, crushed cookies, or nuts at this stage.
    Freeze: Transfer the mixture into a 9x5-inch loaf pan or airtight container. Cover tightly (using parchment paper directly on the surface helps prevent ice crystals) and freeze for 4-6 hours, or until firm.

No-Machine "Bag" Method (5-Minute Technique)
This method is great for quick, single-serving, or fun kid-friendly science projects.
Ingredients:

    1 cup heavy cream or half-and-half
    2 tablespoons sugar
    1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
    3 cups ice
    1/2 cup rock salt or regular salt

Instructions:

    Prep Bags: Mix cream, sugar, and vanilla in a small (1-quart) resealable plastic bag. Seal it, ensuring air is removed.
    Add Ice/Salt: Fill a large (1-gallon) bag with ice and salt.
    Shake: Place the small bag inside the large bag and seal it tightly. Shake vigorously for 5–8 minutes (use a towel, as the bag will get very cold).
    Enjoy: Remove the small bag, rinse off the salt, and eat immediately.

Classic Churned Ice Cream Method
If you have an ice cream machine, you can make a traditional custard-based ice cream.
Ingredients:

    1½ cups heavy cream
    1½ cups whole milk
    ⅔ cup sugar
    1 tablespoon vanilla extract
    Pinch of salt

Instructions:

    Prep: Freeze the bowl of your ice cream maker for at least 12–24 hours before making.
    Combine & Heat: Whisk milk, sugar, salt, and half the cream in a saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and stir in the rest of the cream and vanilla.
    Chill: Chill the mixture in the refrigerator for 2 hours or overnight.
    Churn: Pour the cold mixture into the ice cream maker and churn for 20–30 minutes.
    Set: Serve immediately (soft-serve) or transfer to a container and freeze for 2–3 hours for a firmer texture.

Tips for Success

    Preventing Ice Crystals: Press plastic wrap or parchment paper directly onto the surface of the ice cream before freezing to prevent crystals from forming.
    Best Ingredients: Using full-fat dairy (heavy cream and whole milk) ensures the creamiest texture.
    Preventing Hardness: If the ice cream is too hard after freezing, let it sit on the counter for 5-10 minutes before serving.
